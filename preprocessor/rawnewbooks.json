        "summary": "Deadly Greed reveals the horrifying truth behind one of the most vicious and intriguing murders of the 1980s as the author of Death Sentence tells the true story of how Charles Stuart murdered his pregnant wife and blamed it on a fictitious Black killer. In October of 1989, businessman Charles Stuart called 911 reporting that his pregnant wife, Carol, had been robbed and shot by a Black male in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston. When the police arrived, Carol was already dead, with the baby gone soon after, leading to an attack that incited fear and anger during a time of high racial tensions. When the truth of the murder came out, while the injuries Carol suffered were real, the story of the Black male that shot her was a fictitious cover up told by her husband. Charles Stuart shot his wife, killing her and the baby she was carrying, convinced she was the only thing standing between him and everything he wanted. Though the police eventually unraveled the truth of the case, it did not prevent the conviction of an innocent man that was lined up to take the fall by Charles himself. But as the truth was revealed, the police were able to piece together the puzzle that led to the murder of a wife by her own husband, including distress over the pregnancy, romantic interest in a coworker, and life insurance fraud. Jon Sharkey shares \u201ca picture of a man consumed by naked ambition, unwilling to let anyone or anything get in his way\u201d in this shocking and terrifying account of murder (Library Journal).",

Women were raped on street corners, stores were looted, and pedestrians were beaten and robbed while crowds not only looked on but cheered. The police strike and the mayhem that followed made an inconspicuous governor, Calvin Coolidge, known throughout America, turning him into a national hero and, eventually, a president. It also created a monster: for two days, more than 700,000 residents of Boston's urban core were without police protection, and the mob ruled the streets.",

        "summary": "In The Writing of Where, Charles Lesh examines how graffiti writers in Boston remake various spaces within and across the city. The spaces readers will encounter in this book are not just meaningful venues of writing, but also outcomes of writing itself: social spaces not just where writing happens but created because writing happens. Lesh contends that these graffiti spaces reinvent the writing landscape of the city and its public relationship with writing. Each chapter introduces readers to different writing spaces: from bold and broadly visible spots along the highway to bridge underpasses seldom seen by non-writers; from inconspicuous notebooks writers call bibles to freight yards and model trains; from abandoned factories to benches where writers view trains. Between each chapter, readers will find community interludes, responses to the preceding chapters from some of the graffiti writers who worked on this project. By working closely with writers engaged in the production of these spaces, as well as drawing on work invested in questions of geography, publics, and writing, Lesh identifies new models of community engagement and articulates a framework for the spatiality of the public work of writing and writing studies.",

Tracy Kidder spent five years following Dr. O\u2019Connell and his colleagues as they work with thousands of homeless patients, some of whom we meet in this illuminating book. We travel with O\u2019Connell as he navigates the city streets at night, offering medical care, socks, soup, empathy, humor, and friendship to some of the city\u2019s most endangered citizens. He emphasizes a style of medicine in which patients come first, joined with their providers in what he calls \u201ca system of friends.\u201d Much as he did with Paul Farmer in Mountains Beyond Mountains, Kidder explores how Jim O\u2019Connell and a dedicated group of people have improved countless lives by facing and addressing one of American society\u2019s most difficult problems, instead of looking away.",

        "summary": "The last sixty years have seen tremendous strides in high school education. More young people of all races and backgrounds are graduating from high school, with more credits in tougher courses, than ever before. However, our dropout rate is still too high and far too many graduates are not prepared for college. High school reform for city schools has been particularly challenging where poverty and racism have undermined the high school experience. Educators have relied upon two reform strategies: the curricular strategy focuses on the academic content that is delivered in the classroom, content reformers have adjusted. They also have restructured the high school itself to maximize the impact of the classroom. This book offers an additional strategy, one essential for real change: the cultural reform strategy. Cultural change\u2014a fundamental change in the beliefs, attitudes and expectations of the stakeholders\u2014is difficult to achieve. Yet, without a change in the culture of the high school, curricular and structural reforms will have limited impact on raising student engagement. The authors illustrate the history of high school reform, and develop a case for the necessity of cultural reform, by taking an intimate look at one very typical urban high school\u2014Dorchester High School in Boston. Dorchester High faced trends, policies, and challenges similar to those of high schools all over the country, so that the lessons learned there should be instructive for urban high schools across America. Gonsalves and Leonard also examine Dorchester High in the context of community partnerships and relationships.",

        "summary": "From the almshouses of seventeenth-century Puritans to the massive housing projects of the mid-twentieth century, the struggle over housing assistance in the United States has exposed a deep-seated ambivalence about the place of the urban poor. Lawrence J. Vale's groundbreaking book is both a comprehensive institutional history of public housing in Boston and a broader examination of the nature and extent of public obligation to house socially and economically marginal Americans during the past 350 years. First, Vale highlights startling continuities both in the way housing assistance has been delivered to the American poor and in the policies used to reward the nonpoor. He traces the stormy history of the Boston Housing Authority, a saga of entrenched patronage and virulent racism tempered, and partially overcome, by the efforts of unyielding reformers. He explores the birth of public housing as a program intended to reward the upwardly mobile working poor, details its painful transformation into a system designed to cope with society's least advantaged, and questions current policy efforts aimed at returning to a system of rewards for responsible members of the working class. The troubled story of Boston public housing exposes the mixed motives and ideological complexity that have long characterized housing in America, from the Puritans to the projects.",

He was told that the photographs had been taken by nineteenth\u2013century ornithologist and conservationist William Brewster, but as a result of a tip from a Harvard research assistant, he began to suspect that the images were actually the work of Brewster's African American assistant, Robert A. Gilbert. So begins the author's journey. From the maze\u2013like archives at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology to the Virginia countryside and haunts of American expats in 1920s Paris, as well as the rich cultural world of blacks in nineteenth\u2013century Boston, Mitchell brings sharp focus to the figure of Mr. Gilbert, a quiet, unassuming Renaissance man who succeeded as best as he could beneath the iron ceiling of American racism. Told with Mitchell's trademark grace and style, the fascinating story of this \"invisible man\" deepens our understanding of the African American past as well as the history of American photography.",

I call their names: Abram Alice Amey Arianna Antiqua I call their names: Isaac Jake James Jenny Jim Every last one, property of the Lloyds, the state\u2019s preeminent enslavers. Every last one, with a mind of their own and a story that ain\u2019t yet been told. Till now. Carole and Jeffery Boston Weatherford\u2019s ancestors are among the founders of Maryland. Their family history there extends more than three hundred years, but as with the genealogical searches of many African Americans with roots in slavery, their family tree can only be traced back five generations before going dark. And so from scraps of history, Carole and Jeffery have conjured the voices of their kin, creating an often painful but ultimately empowering story of who their people were in a breathtaking book that is at once deeply personal yet all too universal. Carole\u2019s poems capture voices ranging from her ancestors to Frederick Douglass to Harriet Tubman to the plantation house and land itself that connects them all, and Jeffery\u2019s evocative illustrations help carry the story from the first mention of a forebear listed as property in a 1781 ledger to he and his mother\u2019s homegoing trip to Africa in 2016. Shaped by loss, erasure, and ultimate reclamation, this is the story of not only Carole and Jeffery\u2019s family, but of countless other Black families in America.",

These days, Tre Brun is happiest when he is playing basketball on the Red Lake Reservation high school team--even though he can't help but be constantly gut-punched with memories of his big brother, Jaxon, who died in an accident. When Jaxon's former teammates on the varsity team offer to take Tre under their wing, he sees this as his shot to represent his Ojibwe rez all the way to their first state championship. This is the first step toward his dream of playing in the NBA, no matter how much the odds are stacked against him. But stepping into his brother's shoes as a star player means that Tre can't mess up. Not on the court, not at school, and not with his new friend, gamer Khiana, who he is definitely not falling in love with. After decades of rez teams almost making it, Tre needs to take his team to state. Because if he can live up to Jaxon's dreams, their story isn't over yet. This book is published by Heartdrum, an imprint that publishes high-quality, contemporary stories about Indigenous young people in the United States and Canada.",

Coming barely a year after the infamous Chicago fire, Boston\u2019s inferno turned out to be one of the most expensive fires per acre in US history. Yet today few are aware of how close Boston came to destruction. Boston author Stephanie Schorow masterfully recounts the fire\u2019s history from the foolish decisions that precipitated it to the heroics of firefighters who fought it. Lavishly illustrated with period artwork and photographs and published just before the fire\u2019s 150th anniversary, The Great Boston Fire captures the drama of a life-and-death battle in the heart of the city.",

In fact, however, the city was far from a beacon of equality. In No Right to an Honest Living, historian Jacqueline Jones reveals how Boston was the United States writ small: a place where the soaring rhetoric of egalitarianism was easy, but justice in the workplace was elusive. Before, during, and after the Civil War, white abolitionists and Republicans refused to secure equal employment opportunity for Black Bostonians, condemning most of them to poverty. Still, Jones finds, some Black entrepreneurs ingeniously created their own jobs and forged their own career paths. Highlighting the everyday struggles of ordinary Black workers, this book shows how injustice in the workplace prevented Boston\u2014and the United States\u2014from securing true equality for all.",

        "summary": "In the late nineteenth century, as cities like Boston and New York grew more congested, the streets became clogged with plodding, horse-drawn carts. When the great blizzard of 1888 crippled the entire northeast, a solution had to be found. Two brothers from one of the nation's great families-Henry Melville Whitney of Boston and William Collins Whitney of New York-pursued the dream of his city digging America's first subway, and the great race was on. The competition between Boston and New York played out in an era not unlike our own, one of economic upheaval, life-changing innovations, class warfare, bitter political tensions, and the question of America's place in the world. The Race Underground is peopled with the famous, like Boss Tweed, Grover Cleveland and Thomas Edison, and the not-so-famous, from brilliant engineers to the countless \"sandhogs\" who shoveled, hoisted and blasted their way into the earth's crust, sometimes losing their lives in the construction of the tunnels. Doug Most chronicles the science of the subway, looks at the centuries of fears people overcame about traveling underground and tells a story as exciting as any ever ripped from the pages of U.S. history. The Race Underground is a great American saga of two rival American cities, their rich, powerful and sometimes corrupt interests, and an invention that changed the lives of millions.",

        "summary": "The story of the fascinating, fraught alliance among Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and Maria Weston Chapman\u2014and how its breakup led to the success of America\u2019s most important social movement. \u201cFresh, provocative and engrossing.\u201d \u2014New York Times In the crucial early years of the Abolition movement, the Boston branch of the cause seized upon the star power of the eloquent ex-slave Frederick Douglass to make its case for slaves\u2019 freedom. Journalist William Lloyd Garrison promoted emancipation while Garrison loyalist Maria Weston Chapman, known as \u201cthe Contessa,\u201d raised money and managed Douglass\u2019s speaking tour from her Boston townhouse. Conventional histories have seen Douglass\u2019s departure for the New York wing of the Abolition party as a result of a rift between Douglass and Garrison. But, as acclaimed historian Linda Hirshman reveals, this completely misses the woman in power. Weston Chapman wrote cutting letters to Douglass, doubting his loyalty; the Bostonian abolitionists were shot through with racist prejudice, even aiming the N-word at Douglass among themselves. Through incisive, original analysis, Hirshman convinces that the inevitable breakup was in fact a successful failure. Eventually, as the most sought-after Black activist in America, Douglass was able to dangle the prize of his endorsement over the Republican Party\u2019s candidate for president, Abraham Lincoln. Two years later the abolition of slavery\u2014if not the abolition of racism\u2014became immutable law.",

        "summary": "In 2002, the national spotlight fell on Boston\u2019s archdiocese, where decades of rampant sexual misconduct from priests\u2014and the church\u2019s systematic cover-ups\u2014were exposed by reporters from the Boston Globe. The sordid and tragic stories of abuse and secrecy led many to leave the church outright and others to rekindle their faith and deny any suggestions of institutional wrongdoing. But a number of Catholics vowed to find a middle ground between these two extremes: keeping their faith while simultaneously working to change the church for the better. Beyond Betrayal charts a nationwide identity shift through the story of one chapter of Voice of the Faithful (VOTF), an organization founded in the scandal\u2019s aftermath. VOTF had three goals: helping survivors of abuse; supporting priests who were either innocent or took risky public stands against the wrongdoers; and pursuing a broad set of structural changes in the church. Patricia Ewick and Marc W. Steinberg follow two years in the life of one of the longest-lived and most active chapters of VOTF, whose thwarted early efforts at ecclesiastical reform led them to realize that before they could change the Catholic Church, they had to change themselves. The shaping of their collective identity is at the heart of Beyond Betrayal, an ethnographic portrait of how one group reimagined their place within an institutional order and forged new ideas of faith in the wake of widespread distrust.",

        "summary": "An exploration of how and why American city governments delegated the responsibility for solving urban inequality to the nonprofit sector. Nonprofits serving a range of municipal and cultural needs are now so ubiquitous in US cities, it can be difficult to envision a time when they were more limited in number, size, and influence. Turning back the clock, however, uncovers both an illuminating story of how the nonprofit sector became such a dominant force in American society, as well as a troubling one of why this growth occurred alongside persistent poverty and widening inequality. Claire Dunning\u2019s book connects these two stories in histories of race, democracy, and capitalism, revealing how the federal government funded and deputized nonprofits to help individuals in need, and in so doing avoided addressing the structural inequities that necessitated such action in the first place. Nonprofit Neighborhoods begins after World War II, when suburbanization, segregation, and deindustrialization inaugurated an era of urban policymaking that applied private solutions to public problems. Dunning introduces readers to the activists, corporate executives, and politicians who advocated addressing poverty and racial exclusion through local organizations, while also raising provocative questions about the politics and possibilities of social change. The lessons of Nonprofit Neighborhoods exceed the bounds of Boston, where the story unfolds, providing a timely history of the shift from urban crisis to urban renaissance for anyone concerned about American inequality\u2014past, present, or future.",

The authors show how the district was able to work with and against the constraints of the current accountability system to create a high-quality, whole-child focused, and intellectually engaging program that has had a significant impact in narrowing income-based learning gaps. Written in collaboration with the Department of Early Childhood Education, this account of creating successful preK programs in a diverse urban district will provide a valuable resource for practitioners engaged in similar work across the country. \"This is the book I've been waiting for. Children at the Center includes many voices expressing the importance of high-quality early learning and illustrating how it can be achieved. The Boston case study demonstrates the brilliance of the social justice framework that sustains the vision over time-and highlights the complexity of the dynamic, essential relationships with teachers, principals, community organizations, funders, politicians, and school administrators. After reading this book I am both inspired by possibilities and energized to pursue the transformations still required to best serve all of our children.\" --Valora Washington, CEO, Council for Professional Recognition \"With joyful, purposeful activity as the core value and priority for children, teachers, and even the district's central office staff, the story of Boston Public Schools stands apart from the overarching tone of education reform across the country. Children at the Center presents a clear picture of how to navigate the false dichotomies of play versus rigor, and policy versus practice, not only in preK, but also in the primary grades.\" --Kristie A.

        "summary": "The New England Watch and Ward Society provides a new window into the history of the Protestant establishment's prominent role in late nineteenth-century public life and its confrontation with modernity, commercial culture, and cultural pluralism in early twentieth-century America. Elite liberal Protestants, typically considered progressive, urbane, and tolerant, established the Watch and Ward Society in 1878 to suppress literature they deemed obscene, notably including Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. These self-appointed custodians of Victorian culture enjoyed widespread support from many of New England's most renowned ministers, distinguished college presidents, respected social reformers, and wealthy philanthropists. In the 1880s, the Watch and Ward Society expanded its efforts to regulate public morality by attacking gambling and prostitution. The society not only expressed late nineteenth-century Victorian American values about what constituted \"good literature,\" sexual morality, and public duty, it also embodied Protestants' efforts to promote these values in an increasingly intellectually and culturally diverse society. By 1930, the Watch and Ward Society had suffered a very public fall from grace. Following controversies over the suppression of H.L. Mencken's American Mercury as well as popular novels such as Sinclair Lewis' Elmer Gantry and D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, cultural modernists, civil libertarians, and publishers attacked the moral reform movement, ridiculing its leaders' privileged backgrounds, social idealism, and religious commitments. Their critique reshaped the dynamics of Protestant moral reform activity as well as public discourse in subsequent decades. For more than a generation, however, the Watch and Ward Society expressed mainline Protestant attitudes toward literature, gambling, and sexuality.",

        "summary": "One of America's oldest existing structures, Long Wharf encapsulates the most important events in Boston's history. Created in 1711 and spanning almost a half mile in length, it initially served as a defense for the town of Boston and a place for local merchants to sell and ship their cargo. Multitudes of different merchants had stores there over the decades, and these products changed as the city evolved. From rum, spices, flour, molasses and tea to fishing, immigration and tourism, the Wharf has always reflected the city it served. Long Wharf also had a darker side, with theft, drownings and slavery. Author and historian Kelly Kilcrease reveals how the Wharf was built, how it played a prominent role during the American Revolution and how it evolved into the landmark we know today.",

Boston is transforming its seemingly staid identity as a city of neighborhoods into a more metropolitan place. With essays by Edward Mitchell, Brian Healy ('81), Kishore Varanasi, Tim Love, Aniket Shanane, and Ila Berman, the book focuses on Boston's newest forms of urbanism, the architectural context of the city, and future growth.",

Dream Country author Shannon Gibney returns with a new book woven from her true story of growing up as the adopted Black daughter of white parents and the fictional story of Erin Powers, the name Shannon was given at birth by the white woman who gave her up for adoption. At its core, the novel is a tale of two girls on two different timelines occasionally bridged by a mysterious portal and their shared search for a complete picture of their origins. Gibney surrounds that story with reproductions of her own adoption documents, letters, family photographs, interviews, medical records, and brief essays on the surreal absurdities of the adoptee experience. The end result is a remarkable portrait of an American experience rarely depicted in any form.",

A Nazi killer made with kishuf, an ancient and profane magic. When Vera awakens, she can feel her violent purpose--her reason for existing--thrumming within her. But she can feel other things, too: glimpses of a human life lived, of stolen kisses amid the tragedy, and of a grisly death. And when she meets Akiva, she recognizes the boy with soft lips that gave warm kisses. But these memories aren't hers, and Vera doesn't know if she gets to have a life beyond what she was made for. If she deserves one. Vera's strength feels limitless--until she learns that there are others who would use kishuf for means far less noble than avenging a daughter's death. As she confronts the very basest of humanity, Vera will need more than what her creator gave her: not just a reason to fight, but a reason to live.",

Now for the first time, he draws his own life, revisiting his childhood in Cuba and his family\u2019s passage on the infamous Mariel boatlift. When Edel was nine, Fidel Castro announced his surprising decision to let 125,000 traitors of the revolution, or \u201cworms,\u201d leave the country. The faltering economy and Edel\u2019s family\u2019s vocal discomfort with government surveillance had made their daily lives on a farm outside Havana precarious, and they secretly planned to leave. But before that happened, a dozen soldiers confiscated their home and property and imprisoned them in a detention center near the port of Mariel, where they were held with dissidents and criminals before being marched to a flotilla that miraculously deposited them, overnight, in Florida. Through vivid, stirring art, Worm tells a story of a boyhood in the midst of the Cold War, a family\u2019s displacement in exile, and their tenacious longing for those they left behind. It also recounts the coming-of-age of an artist and activist, who, witnessing American\u2019s turn from democracy to extremism, struggles to differentiate his adoptive country from the dictatorship he fled. Confronting questions of patriotism and the liminal nature of belonging, Edel Rodriguez ultimately celebrates the immigrants, maligned and overlooked, who guard and invigorate American freedom.",

What Effie hasn\u2019t told anyone is that she already knows exactly what school she has her heart set on: a college in NYC with a major in Mass Media & Society that will set her up perfectly for her dream job in digital media. She\u2019s never been to New York, but paging through the brochure, she can picture the person she\u2019ll be there, far from the Minneapolis neighborhood where she's lived her entire life. When she finds out that Wilder (her longtime crush) is applying there too, it seems like one more sign from the universe that it\u2019s the right place for her. But it turns out that the universe is full of surprises. As Effie navigates her way through a year of admissions visits, senior class traditions, internal and external ableism, and a lot of firsts--and lasts--she starts to learn that sometimes growing up means being open to a world of possibilities you never even dreamed of. And maybe being more than just friends with Wilder is one of those dreams...",

White-knuckling her way through high school with flawed executive functioning has left her burnt out and ready to start fresh. Working as an intern for her perfect older sister\u2019s start up isn\u2019t exactly how Tilly wants to spend her summer, but the required travel around Europe promises a much-needed change of scenery as she plans for her future.

His autism has often made it hard for him to form relationships with others, but his love of color theory and design allows him to feel deeply connected to the world around him. Plus, he has everything he needs: a best friend that gets him, placement into a prestigious design program, and a summer internship to build his resume. Everything is going as planned. That is, of course, until he suffers through the most disastrous international flight of his life, all turmoil stemming from lively and exasperating Tilly. Oliver is forced to spend the summer with a girl that couldn\u2019t be more his opposite\u2014feeling things for her he can\u2019t quite name\u2014and starts to wonder if maybe he doesn\u2019t have everything figured out after all. As the duo\u2019s neurodiverse connection grows, they learn that some of the best parts of life can\u2019t be planned, and are forced to figure out what that means as their disastrously wonderful summer comes to an end.",

A global plague has brought the world to a screeching halt, and with little to look forward to but a summer of video-calling friends, vying with annoying sisters for the family computer, and tuning out his parents\u2019 financial worries, he\u2019s only too happy to retreat to the woods.

MacNolia Cox was no ordinary kid. Her idea of fun was reading the dictionary. In 1936, eighth grader MacNolia Cox became the first African American to win the Akron, Ohio, spelling bee. And with that win, she was asked to compete at the prestigious National Spelling Bee in Washington, DC, where she and a girl from New Jersey were the first African Americans invited since its founding. She left her home state a celebrity\u2014right up there with Ohio\u2019s own Joe Louis and Jesse Owens\u2014with a military band and a crowd of thousands to see her off at the station. But celebration turned to chill when the train crossed the state line into Maryland, where segregation was the law of the land. Prejudice and discrimination ruled\u2014on the train, in the hotel, and, sadly, at the spelling bee itself. With a brief epilogue recounting MacNolia\u2019s further history, How Do You Spell Unfair? is the story of her groundbreaking achievement magnificently told by award-winning creators and frequent picture-book collaborators Carole Boston Weatherford and Frank Morrison.",

The contributions discuss how the trust structure, with its inherent malleability, has been adapted to meet a diverse set of local needs, including social, religious, economic, commercial, or even historical needs. But in most instances, those needs - and the ways in which trusts law has been adapted to meet them - are not unique to a single jurisdiction: they often (coincidentally or otherwise) find much in common with others. By making its readers aware of the commonality of needs in Asia- Pacific, this book also aims to encourage coordination and cooperation in utilising trusts law to address shared concerns across the region.",

In contrast to the infamous violence and rage that greeted forced school busing within the city in the 1970s, the work of METCO has quietly and calmly promoted school integration. But how has this program affected the lives of its graduates? Would they choose to participate if they had it to do over again? Would they place their own children on the bus to suburbia? In The Other Boston Busing Story, sixty-five METCO graduates who are now adults answer those questions and more, vividly recalling their own stories and assessing the benefits and hardships of crossing racial and class lines on their way to school. As courts and policymakers today are forcing the abandonment of desegregation, this book offers an accessible and moving account of a rare program that, despite serious challenges, provides a practical remedy for the persistent inequalities in American education. This new edition puts the original findings in a contemporary context.",

        "summary": "The bestselling author of In the Heart of the Sea, Mayflower, and In the Hurricane's Eye tells the story of the Boston battle that ignited the American Revolution, in this \"masterpiece of narrative and perspective.\" (Boston Globe) In the opening volume of his acclaimed American Revolution series, Nathaniel Philbrick turns his keen eye to pre-Revolutionary Boston and the spark that ignited the American Revolution. In the aftermath of the Boston Tea Party and the violence at Lexington and Concord, the conflict escalated and skirmishes gave way to outright war in the Battle of Bunker Hill. It was the bloodiest conflict of the revolutionary war, and the point of no return for the rebellious colonists. Philbrick gives us a fresh view of the story and its dynamic personalities, including John Adams, Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Paul Revere, and George Washington. With passion and insight, he reconstructs the revolutionary landscape\u2014geographic and ideological\u2014in a mesmerizing narrative of the robust, messy, blisteringly real origins of America.",

        "summary": "The Boston Tea Party of 1773 was an audacious and revolutionary act. It set the stage for war and cemented certain values in the American psyche. But why did the Tea Party happen? Whom did it involve? What did it mean? Benjamin L. Carp tells the story of the Tea Party--exploding myths, exploring the unique city life of Boston, and setting this extraordinary event in a global context. Bringing to life the diverse array of people and places that the Tea Party brought together--from Chinese tea-pickers to English businessmen, Native American tribes, sugar plantation slaves, and Boston's ladies of leisure--Carp illuminates how a determined group shook the foundations of a mighty empire, and what this has meant for Americans since",
