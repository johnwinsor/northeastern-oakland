A corporate satire follows a pair of dark operatives working for a chicken franchise as they take careful revenge on counterfeiters. A coder calculates the odds of her husband's cold developing complications and killing him, in a story told in code. A relationship at breaking point is told via a scrambled timeline of events that works like a puzzle. A man spends his inheritance on technology that will allow him to fly. And an archeologist working for mining companies against the interests of Indigenous communities develops a mysterious psychological condition that causes her to black out and commit extreme acts of generosity."

        "summary": "The contributors to The Black Geographic explore the theoretical innovations of Black Geographies scholarship and how it approaches Blackness as historically and spatially situated. In studies that span from Oakland to the Alabama Black Belt to Senegal to Brazil, the contributors draw on ethnography, archival records, digital humanities, literary criticism, and art to show how understanding the spatial dimensions of Black life contributes to a broader understanding of race and space. They examine key sites of inquiry: Black spatial imaginaries, resistance to racial violence, the geographies of racial capitalism, and struggles over urban space. Throughout, the contributors demonstrate that Blackness is itself a situating and place-making force, even as it is shaped by spatial processes and diasporic routes. Whether discussing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century abolitionist print records or migration and surveillance in Niger, this volume demonstrates that Black Geographies is a mode of analyzing Blackness that fundamentally challenges the very foundations of the field of geography and its historical entwinement with colonialism, enslavement, and imperialism. In short, it marks a new step in the evolution of the field. Contributors. Anna Livia Brand, C.N.E.

Inside, you'll find: Rules to create your scoundrel using the following character archetypes: The Cutter, the Hound, the Leech, the Lurk, the Slide, the Spider, or the Whisper.

        "summary": "Anti-racist Community Engagement: Principles and Practices centers anti-racist community-engaged traditions that BIPOC academics and community members have created through more than a century of collaboration across university and community. It demonstrates both the progress and the work that still needs to be done. The book is organized around a set of Anti-racist Community Engagement Principles developed by the editors as part of their shared work and dialogue with colleagues regionally and across the country. The significant number of diverse voices that have informed the creation of the principles reveal the groundswell of work underway to center anti-racist values and to pivot away from the traditional, higher education-centric, and \"white savior\" ways of doing community engagement teaching, research, and practice. The chapters in this book are organized into four sections, each focused on one of the four Anti-racist Community Engagement Principles. The first section explores the various ways in which reframing our institutional and pedagogical practices can help counteract the persistence and impact of racism on our campuses and in our community engagement work. In the second section, authors share practices that promote critical reflection on individual and systemic/structural racism through examinations of positionality, bias, and historical roots of systemic racism. The third section examines intentional learning and course design through anti-racist learning goals, course content, policies, and assessment. Finally, the fourth section shows how authors have developed compassionate and reflective classrooms by creating a sense of belonging that acknowledges student cultural assets and contributions and meets students where they are to co-create a supportive anti-racist learning environment. Each chapter in the book introduces a specific example of anti-racist community engagement, with authors providing unique, situated insights into the nature and complexity of the factors at play. This is followed by a \"Practice\" section where authors reflect on their engagement, and the lessons learned through it, thus leaving readers with detailed insights and roadmaps for adapting or replicating the work. Finally, a \"Connections\" section places the case and its practices into broader contexts of pedagogical, curricular, institutional, and community change. There is an open access digital companion to the volume, where authors have shared materials that will help shed further light on their compelling practices, including syllabi, agendas, handouts, worksheets, and additional resources."

Dan Berger and Toussaint Losier show that prisoners have used strikes, lawsuits, uprisings, writings, and diverse coalitions with free-world allies to challenge prison conditions and other kinds of inequality. From the forced labor camps of the nineteenth century to the rebellious protests of the 1960s and 1970s to the rise of mass incarceration and its discontents, Rethinking the American Prison Movement is invaluable to anyone interested in the history of American prisons and the struggles for justice still echoing in the present day."

        "summary": "\"A remarkable work about women writers in the Renaissance explodes our notion of the Shakespearean period and brings us in close to four women who were committed to their craft before there was any possibility of \"a room of one's own.\" In a sparkling and engaging narrative of everyday life in Shakespearean England, Ramie Targoff carries us from the sumptuous coronation of Queen Elizabeth in the mid 16th century into the private lives of four women writers working without acknowledgment at a time when women were legally the property of men. Some readers may have heard of Mary Sidney, accomplished poet and sister of the famous Sir Philip Sidney, but few will have heard of Amelia Lanyer, the first woman to publish a book of poetry in the 17th century, which offered a feminist take on the crucifixion, or Elizabeth Cary, who published the first original play by a woman, about the plight of the Jewish princess Mariam. Then there was Anne Clifford, a lifelong diarist, who fought for decades against a patriarchy that tried to rob her of her land, in one of England's most infamous inheritance battles. These women had husbands and children to care for and little support for their art, yet against all odds they defined themselves as writers, finding rooms of their own whose doors had been shut for centuries. Targoff flings them open to uncover the treasures left by these extraordinary women by helping us see the period in a fresh light and by supplying an expanded reading of history and a much-needed female perspective on life in Shakespeare's day\"--"

        "summary": "Making Black Girls Count in Math Education explores the experiences of Black girls and women in mathematics from preschool to graduate school, deftly probing race and gender inequity in STEM fields. Nicole M. Joseph investigates factors that contribute to the glaring underrepresentation of Black female students in the mathematics pipeline. Joseph's unflinching account calls attention to educational structures and practices that contribute to race- and gender-based stratification in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. The author also disentangles a complex network of historical and sociopolitical elements that influence the perception and experiences of Black girls and women both inside and outside of mathematics education. In her clear-eyed assessment of the intersectional difficulties facing this marginalized group, Joseph offers a critical view of the existing mathematics education research, practice, and policies that have neglected Black girls and women; confronts the problematic history of mathematics education policy; and considers imbalances in the current teacher workforce in US mathematics programs. She then provides practical, actionable suggestions for reform. Joseph invites students, families, and educators, as well as researchers, policy makers, and other relevant stakeholders to disrupt systems, structures, and ideologies. She calls for an end to racism and sexism in many areas of mathematics education, including learning environments, curriculum design and implementation, and testing and assessments. An essential read for anyone concerned about supporting the mathematical learning and development of Black girls and women, this work advocates for coalition-building so that greater, more equitable opportunities for learning and engagement may be offered to Black female students."

        "summary": "View \"Public Restrooms\": A Photo Gallery in The Atlantic Monthly. So much happens in the public toilet that we never talk about. Finding the right door, waiting in line, and using the facilities are often undertaken with trepidation. Don\u2019t touch anything. Try not to smell. Avoid eye contact. And for men, don\u2019t look down or let your eyes stray. Even washing one\u2019s hands are tied to anxieties of disgust and humiliation. And yet other things also happen in these spaces: babies are changed, conversations are had, make-up is applied, and notes are scrawled for posterity. Beyond these private issues, there are also real public concerns: problems of public access, ecological waste, and\u2014in many parts of the world\u2014sanitation crises. At public events, why are women constantly waiting in long lines but not men? Where do the homeless go when cities decide to close public sites? Should bathrooms become standardized to accommodate the disabled? Is it possible to create a unisex bathroom for transgendered people? In Toilet, noted sociologist Harvey Molotch and Laura Nor\u00e9n bring together twelve essays by urbanists, historians and cultural analysts (among others) to shed light on the public restroom. These noted scholars offer an assessment of our historical and contemporary practices, showing us the intricate mechanisms through which even the physical design of restrooms\u2014the configurations of stalls, the number of urinals, the placement of sinks, and the continuing segregation of women\u2019s and men\u2019s bathrooms\u2014reflect and sustain our cultural attitudes towards gender, class, and disability. Based on a broad range of conceptual, political, and down-to-earth viewpoints, the original essays in this volume show how the bathroom\u2014as a practical matter\u2014reveals competing visions of pollution, danger and distinction. Although what happens in the toilet usually stays in the toilet, this brilliant, revelatory, and often funny book aims to bring it all out into the open, proving that profound and meaningful history can be made even in the can.

        "summary": "An inside look at how police officers are trained to perpetuate state violence Michael Brown. Philando Castile. George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. As the names of those killed by the police became cemented into public memory, the American public took to the streets in unprecedented numbers to mourn, organize, and demand changes to the current system of policing. In response, police departments across the country committed themselves to change, pledging to hire more women and people of color, incorporate diversity training, and instruct officers to verbally de-escalate interactions with the public. These reform efforts tend to rely on a \u201cbad apple\u201d argument, focusing the nature and scope of the problem on the behavior of specific individuals and rarely considering the broader organizational process that determines who is allowed to patrol the public and how they learn to do their jobs. In Before the Badge, Samantha J. Simon provides a firsthand look into how police officers are selected and trained, describing every stage of the process, including recruitment, classroom instruction, and tactical training. Simon spent a year at police academies participating in the training alongside cadets, giving her a visceral, hands-on understanding of how police training operates. Using rich and detailed examples, she reveals that the process does more than test a cadet\u2019s physical or intellectual abilities. Instead, it socializes cadets into a system of state violence. As training progresses, cadets are expected to see themselves as warriors and to view Black and Latino/a members of the public as their enemies. Cadets who cannot or will not uphold this approach end up washing out. In Before the Badge, Simon explains how this training creates a context in which patterns of police violence persist and implores readers to re-envision the future of policing in the United States."

        "summary": "Poor corporate governance can have significant implications for the lives of ordinary people, whether in the most highly developed countries or in developing world, as illustrated by recent failures at Enron and WorldCom. This publication, based on case studies in Brazil, Chile, India, and South Africa, illustrates the importance of good corporate governance in developing countries, in helping to increase financial capital to firms and to achieving sustained productivity growth. However, its value cannot be considered in isolation, since financial sector measures are required to strengthen the banking sector and financial institutions as a whole, as well as focusing on competition policy and reforms of sector-specific regulatory practices."

        "summary": "The #MeToo movement inspired millions to testify to the widespread experience of sexual violence. More broadly, it shifted the deeply ingrained response to women's accounts of sexual violence from doubting all of them to believing some of them. What changed? Leigh Gilmore provides a new account of #MeToo that reveals how storytelling by survivors propelled the call for sexual justice beyond courts and high-profile cases. At a time when the cultural conversation was fixated on appeals to legal and bureaucratic systems, narrative activism--storytelling in the service of social change--elevated survivors as authorities. Their testimony fused credibility and accountability into the #MeToo effect: uniting millions of separate accounts into an existential demand for sexual justice and the right to be heard. Gilmore reframes #MeToo as a breakthrough moment within a longer history of feminist thought and activism. She analyzes the centrality of autobiographical storytelling in intersectional and antirape activism and traces how literary representations of sexual violence dating from antiquity intertwine with cultural notions of doubt, obligation, and agency. By focusing on the intersectional prehistory of #MeToo, Gilmore sheds light on how survivors have used narrative to frame sexual violence as an urgent problem requiring structural solutions in diverse global contexts. Considering the roles of literature and literary criticism in movements for social change, The #MeToo Effect demonstrates how \"reading like a survivor\" provides resources for activism."

        "summary": "Over the five decades of her writing career Willa Cather responded to, and entered into dialogue with, shifts in the terrain of American life. These cultural encounters informed her work as much as the historical past in which much of her writing is based. Cather was a multifaceted cultural critic, immersing herself in the arts, broadly defined: theater and opera, art, narrative, craft production. Willa Cather and the Arts shows that Cather repeatedly engaged with multiple forms of art, and that even when writing about the past she was often addressing contemporary questions. The essays in this volume are informed by new modes of contextualization, including the increasingly popular view of Cather as a pivotal or transitional figure working between and across very different cultural periods and by the recent publication of Cather\u2019s correspondence. The collection begins by exploring the ways Cather encountered and represented high and low cultures, including Cather\u2019s use of \u201cracialized vernacular\u201d in Sapphira and the Slave Girl. The next set of essays demonstrates how historical research, often focusing on local features in Cather\u2019s fiction, contributes to our understanding of American culture, from musicological sources to the cultural development of Pittsburgh. The final trio of essays highlights current Cather scholarship, including a food studies approach to O Pioneers! and an examination of Cather\u2019s use of ancient philosophy in The Professor\u2019s House. Together the essays reassess Cather\u2019s lifelong encounter with, and interpretation and reimagining of, the arts."

        "summary": "A dazzling hybrid of personal memoir and criticism, considering the work of Black visual artists as a means to explore loss, legacy, and the reclamation of life through art. At the age of twenty-one, Erica Cardwell finds herself in New York City, reeling from the loss of her mother and numb to the world around her. She turns inward instead, reading books and composing poetry, eventually falling into the work of artists such as Blondell Cummings, Lorna Simpson, Lorraine O'Grady, and Kara Walker. Through them, she communes with her mother's spirit and legacy, and finds new ways to interrogate her writing and identity. Wrong Is Not My Name weaves together autobiography, criticism, and theory, and considers how Black women create alternative, queer, and 'hysterical' lives through visual culture and performance. In poetic, interdisciplinary essays-combining analytical and lyrical stream-of-consciousness-Cardwell examines archetypes such as the lascivious Jezebel, the caretaking Mammy, and the elusive Sapphire to formulate new and inventive ways to write about art. Pioneering and inquisitive, Wrong Is Not My Name celebrates Black womanhood, and illuminates the ways in which art and storytelling reside at the core of being human."

        "summary": "An accessible and important look at what is truly behind our digital outrage On any given day, at any given hour, across the various platforms constituting what we call social media, someone is angry. Facebook. Instagram. Twitter. Reddit. 4Chan. In The Rhetoric of Outrage: Why Social Media is Making Us Angry Professor Jeff Rice addresses the increasingly critical question of why anger has become the dominant digital response on social media. He examines the theoretical and rhetorical explanations for the intense rage that prevails across social media platforms, and sheds new light on how our anger isn't merely a reaction against singular events, but generated out of subversive, aggregated beliefs and ideas. Captivating, accessible, and exceedingly important, The Rhetoric of Outrage: Why Social Media Is Making Us Angry encourages readers to have the difficult conversations about what is truly behind their anger."

        "summary": "Mark Anthony Neal\u2019s Looking for Leroy is an engaging and provocative analysis of the complex ways in which black masculinity has been read and misread through contemporary American popular culture. Neal argues that black men and boys are bound, in profound ways, to and by their legibility. The most \u201clegible\u201d black male bodies are often rendered as criminal, bodies in need of policing and containment. Ironically, Neal argues, this sort of legibility brings welcome relief to white America, providing easily identifiable images of black men in an era defined by shifts in racial, sexual, and gendered identities. Neal highlights the radical potential of rendering legible black male bodies\u2014those bodies that are all too real for us\u2014as illegible, while simultaneously rendering illegible black male bodies\u2014those versions of black masculinity that we can\u2019t believe are real\u2014as legible. In examining figures such as hip-hop entrepreneur and artist Jay-Z, R&B Svengali R. Kelly, the late vocalist Luther Vandross, and characters from the hit HBO series The Wire, among others, Neal demonstrates how distinct representations of black masculinity can break the links in the public imagination that create antagonism toward black men. Looking for Leroy features close readings of contemporary black masculinity and popular culture, highlighting both the complexity and accessibility of black men and boys through visual and sonic cues within American culture, media, and public policy. By rendering legible the illegible, Neal maps the range of identifications and anxieties that have marked the performance and reception of post-Civil Rights era African American masculinity. Mark Anthony Neal is Professor of African & African American Studies at Duke University. He is the author of several books including New Black Man and Soul Babies: Black Popular Culture and the Post-Soul Aesthetic and the host of the weekly webcast Left of Black."

Their answers poignantly show that this type of racial integration is not easy-they struggled to negotiate both black and white worlds, often feeling fully accepted in neither. Even so, nearly all the participants believe the long-term gains outweighed the costs and would choose a similar program for their own children-though not without conditions and apprehensions\"--"

        "summary": "First critical biography of this visionary artist written by a dance scholar Simone Forti, groundbreaking improvisor, has spent a lifetime weaving together the movement of her mind with the movement of her body to create a unique oeuvre situated at the intersection of dancing and art practices. Her seminal Dance Constructions from the 1960s crafted a new approach to dance composition and helped inspire the investigations of Judson Dance Theater. In the 1970s, Forti's explorations of animal movements expanded that legacy to launch improvisation as a valuable artform in its own right. From her early forays into vocal accompaniment to her News Animations, Forti has long integrated gesture and text into compelling performances that consistently stretched the boundaries of dance to layer abstract movement with story-telling and political commentary. Her \"Land Portraits\" series brought an immersive ecological experience to New York City stages in the 1980s, and she is a beloved teacher and mentor whose Body, Mind, World workshops have inspired dancers around the world. In this beautifully written book, author Ann Cooper Albright braids archival research, extensive interviews, and detailed movement analyses of Forti's performances to provide the first kinesthetically-informed and critically-nuanced history of Forti's multifaceted and extensive career."

        "summary": "As wealthy countries build literal and figurative walls to keep migrants out, Ethiopia has welcomed refugees through policies that promote local integration. But do these policies enable refugees to consider their new country home? Focusing on the experiences of Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia, Hosting States and Unsettled Guests tracks the introduction, implementation, and evolution of policies that began in summer 2016, shortly before the New York Summit on Refugees prompted new national refugee legislation in Ethiopia. Using ethnographic interviews and participant observation with government officials, intragovernmental organizations, NGOs, and refugees in three camps in northern Ethiopia and Addis Ababa, Jennifer Riggan and Amanda Poole explore new efforts to halt treacherous, secondary migration to Europe. In particular, they explore the concept of refugee time-making, a theoretical model to better understand precarity, and a focus on education. An important read, Hosting States and Unsettled Guests makes key empirical and theoretical contributions in forced migration studies, East African studies, and anthropology. Riggan and Poole deftly shift the focus of refugee studies away from Europe to regions in the Global South, revealing emerging forms of migration management."

Historian Ted Clarke explores these stories both the familiar and the obscure that have earned Boston such epithets as 'the epicenter of American crime fiction', 'the cradle of liberty' and 'the ice cream capital of the world'. The fifteen-foot tidal wave of molasses that roared down Commercial Street in 1919 is one of the more famous legends. Lesser known, but equally stunning, is the case of Albert Tirrell, who in 1845 murdered his mistress in a Boston boardinghouse but was released after presenting the first successful sleepwalking defense in the United States. From the mysterious story of John Jacob Loud, who patented the first ballpoint pen, to the dubious early enterprises of merchant prince turned philanthropist Thomas Perkins, Boston Curiosities offers up a medley of memorable events that give Beantown its celebrated flavor."

        "summary": "\"The air was electric at California's Capitol. At a rally on the building steps, one speaker after another railed against a new bill to regulate parents' vaccination choices. If it passed, parents could no longer skirt California's daycare and school vaccine requirements by claiming religious or philosophical objections to vaccines. In response to attempts to eliminate these nonmedical exemptions (NMEs), Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shouted to the crowd that \"parents know best\" when it comes to their children's health. Bob Sears, the pediatrician author of best-seller The Vaccine Book, called on parents to \"Get out there and fight for your rights!\" Protestors, many of them dressed in red shirts, chanted, \"My Child, My Choice.\" Signs amplified their message: \"Force my veggies, not vaccines\" and \"Protect the Children, Not Big Pharma.\"\"--"

        "summary": "\"Racial strife, increased social and economic discrimination, amplified political friction, and growing uncertainty around the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change have laid bare many inequalities within the city of Boston. How will these disruptions and inequities influence the city's future, especially as Boston celebrates its quadricentennial in 2030? This collection of original essays addresses the many challenges Boston contends with in the twenty-first century and considers ways to improve the city for everyone. Presenting a range of perspectives written by area experts-academics, reflective practitioners, and policymakers-these essays tackle issues of resiliency, mobility, affordable housing, health outcomes, social equity, economic equality, zoning, regionalism, and more. Reflecting the diversity of the city and the challenges and opportunities Boston currently faces, Idea City will help readers think differently about their own areas of expertise and help them draw conclusions from urban regeneration work in other fields. In addition to the volume editor, contributors include Dan Adams, Marie Law Adams, Alice Brown, Michelle Danila, Kate Gilbert, Rebecca Herst, Matthew J. Kiefer, Theodore C. Landsmark, Anne-Marie Lubenau, Rosalyn Negr\u00f3n, Antonio Raciti, Tamara Roy, and Andres Sevtsuk\"--"

Entitled \"Veiled Voyagers: Muslim Women Travellers from Asia and the Middle East\" the project recovered, translated, annotated, and analyzed original texts gathered here and available in part on a website. -- The historical experiences of Muslim women offer a fascinating and understudied point of insight into the role of imperial, colonial, and global history. This collection not only recovers the voices of women from a broad range of languages but also provides the historical and cultural contexts necessary to understand the full import of what these women were trying to convey of their experiences in the world. -- Indiana University Press has a strong tradition of making space for the voices, perspectives, and experiences of Muslim women. This collection makes an important contribution to this tradition in its topic but perhaps more importantly it also encourages future scholarship in the field through the academic infrastructure which undergirds the texts included. -- The audience for the work is students and scholars of gender, Muslim identity, globalization, autobiographical and travel writing, women's studies, women's writing, colonial history, and religious history. -- The collection has an accompanying website (which is broader in scope to include both travel and autobiographical writing by Muslim women) at accessingmuslimlives.org."

Then, from afar, she sees Pardalita, a senior and a gifted artist who's moving to Lisbon to study in the fall. The two girls get to know each other while working on a play. And Raquel falls in love.

        "summary": "A cutting-edge view of the digital humanities at a time of global pandemic, catastrophe, and uncertainty Where do the digital humanities stand in 2023? Debates in the Digital Humanities 2023 presents a state-of-the-field vision of digital humanities amid rising social, political, economic, and environmental crises; a global pandemic; and the deepening of austerity regimes in U.S. higher education. Providing a look not just at where DH stands but also where it is going, this fourth volume in the Debates in the Digital Humanities series features both established scholars and emerging voices pushing the field's boundaries, asking thorny questions, and providing space for practitioners to bring to the fore their research and their hopes for future directions in the field. Carrying forward the themes of political and social engagement present in the series throughout, it includes crucial contributions to the field--from a vital forum centered on the voices of Black women scholars, manifestos from feminist and Latinx perspectives on data and DH, and a consideration of Indigenous data and artificial intelligence, to essays that range across topics such as the relation of DH to critical race theory, capital, and accessibility.

        "summary": "In recent years, dozens of counties in North Carolina have partnered with federal law enforcement in the criminalization of immigration--what many have dubbed \"crimmigration.\" Southern border enforcement still monopolizes the national immigration debate, but immigration enforcement has become common within the United States as well. While Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations are a major part of American immigration enforcement, Felicia Arriaga maintains that ICE relies on an already well-established system--the use of local law enforcement and local governments to identify, incarcerate, and deport undocumented immigrants. Arriaga contends that the long-term partnership between local sheriffs and immigration law enforcement in places like North Carolina has created a form of racialized social control of the Latinx community. Arriaga uses data from five county sheriff's offices and their governing bodies to trace the creation and subsequent normalization of ICE and local law enforcement partnerships. Arriaga argues that the methods used by these partnerships to control immigration are employed throughout the United States, but they have been particularly visible in North Carolina, where the Latinx population increased by 111 percent between 2000 and 2010. Arriaga's evidence also reveals how Latinx communities are resisting and adapting to these systems."

It is a tale of cooperation between Washington and London, but also a story of divisions and disputes. The brutal economic realities of the decade, globalisation, and wider geopolitical challenges all complicated this relationship. Policy and action were also affected by changes elsewhere in the world. Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution brought a new form of political Islamic radicalism to prominence. The fears engendered by the Ayatollah and his followers, coupled to the blustering rhetoric of Pakistani leaders, gave rise to the \u2018Islamic bomb\u2019, a nuclear weapon supposedly created by Pakistan to be shared amongst the Muslim ummah. This study thus combines cultural, diplomatic, economic, and political history to offer a rigorous, deeply researched account of a critical moment in nuclear history."

        "summary": "Boston's metropolitan landscape has been two hundred years in the making. From its proto-suburban village centers of 1800 to its far-flung, automobile-centric exurbs of today, Boston has been a national pacesetter for suburbanization. In The Hub's Metropolis, James O'Connell charts the evolution of Boston's suburban development. The city of Boston is compact and consolidated -- famously, \"the Hub.\" Greater Boston, however, stretches over 1,736 square miles and ranks as the world's sixth largest metropolitan area. Boston suburbs began to develop after 1820, when wealthy city dwellers built country estates that were just a short carriage ride away from their homes in the city. Then, as transportation became more efficient and affordable, the map of the suburbs expanded. The Metropolitan Park Commission's park-and-parkway system, developed in the 1890s, created a template for suburbanization that represents the country's first example of regional planning. O'Connell identifies nine layers of Boston's suburban development, each of which has left its imprint on the landscape: traditional villages; country retreats; railroad suburbs; streetcar suburbs (the first electric streetcar boulevard, Beacon Street in Brookline, was designed by Frederic Law Olmsted); parkway suburbs, which emphasized public greenspace but also encouraged commuting by automobile; mill towns, with housing for workers; upscale and middle-class suburbs accessible by outer-belt highways like Route 128; exurban, McMansion-dotted sprawl; and smart growth. Still a pacesetter, Greater Boston has pioneered antisprawl initiatives that encourage compact, mixed-use development in existing neighborhoods near railroad and transit stations. O'Connell reminds us that these nine layers of suburban infrastructure are still woven into the fabric of the metropolis. Each chapter suggests sites to visit, from Waltham country estates to Cambridge triple-deckers."

But most people are probably unaware of some of the most amazing and forgotten Irish men and women who helped mold this city. There was Patrick Gilmore, America's first famed bandleader. Louis Sullivan was the \"Father of the Skyscraper.\" Other colorful characters included Patsy Donovan, the man who discovered Babe Ruth, and Ann \"Goody\" Glover, whose horrifying ordeal launched the Salem Witch Trials. Although each played a noteworthy role in his or her era, all have been unjustly forgotten. Local author Peter Stevens uncovers the missing pieces of the Irish experience in Boston."

Constitutional provisions can be found in both the Federal and State constitutions for executive clemency through pardon and/or parole by the President and/or governors as part of their constitutional powers. Presidents and governors have used their clemency authority throughout the history of the country. Every state contains both statutes and regulations dealing with pardon/parole. The statutes provide law for pardon and parole, but it is administrative agencies (agencies, boards, commissions) that actually draw up the regulations for the procedures of carrying out pardons and paroles. The text of these laws and regulations are quite long and I have had to restrict the content of both chapters to listing only the chapters under each state's statutes and regulations.--Publisher."

        "summary": "The future of smart cities has arrived, courtesy of citizens and their phones. To prove it, Dan O'Brien explains the transformative insights gleaned from years researching Boston's 311 reporting system, a sophisticated city management tool that has revolutionized how ordinary Bostonians use and maintain public spaces. Through its phone service, mobile app, website, and Twitter account, 311 catalogues complaints about potholes, broken street lights, graffiti, litter, vandalism, and other issues that are no one citizen's responsibility but affect everyone's quality of life. The Urban Commons offers a pioneering model of what modern digital data and technology can do for cities like Boston that seek both prosperous growth and sustainability. Analyzing a rich trove of data, O'Brien discovers why certain neighborhoods embrace the idea of custodianship and willingly invest their time to monitor the city's common environments and infrastructure. On the government's side of the equation, he identifies best practices for implementing civic technologies that engage citizens, for deploying public services in collaborative ways, and for utilizing the data generated by these efforts. Boston's 311 system has narrowed the gap between residents and their communities, and between constituents and local leaders. The result, O'Brien shows, has been the creation of more effective policy and practices that reinvigorate the way citizens and city governments approach their mutual interests. By unpacking when, why, and how the 311 system has worked for Boston, The Urban Commons reveals the power and potential of this innovative system, and the lessons learned that other cities can adapt.--"

        "summary": "This book provides robust insights into the current policies, trends, challenges and possibilities in the internationalisation of higher education in East and Southeast Asian countries, revealing emergent and new models and practices in this area, and discussing implications for mutual learning across different education systems. Drawing on case studies from Laos, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, South Korea, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) and other parts of China, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and Japan, this volume addresses emergent and less-heard perspectives on and experiences in the internationalisation of higher education. By detailing, comparing and contrasting the key aspects of internationalisation across countries in Asia and the West, it discusses the implications for mutual learning across different higher education systems. Through practical case studies, this book brings to light the voices and experiences of researchers, who are studying core and new issues, opportunities and challenges facing the internationalisation of higher education in East and Southeast Asia. East and Southeast Asian Perspectives on the Internationalisation of Higher Education is a must-read text for practitioners, international education policy makers and advisors at the national and institutional levels. It will also be of interest to academics, researchers, administrators, students of international and comparative education courses, as well as anyone researching the internationalisation of higher education or looking to learn more about what internationalisation could look like in the future."

        "summary": "This field-defining collection consolidates and builds momentum in the burgeoning area of affect studies. The contributors include many of the central theorists of affect\u2014those visceral forces beneath, alongside, or generally other than conscious knowing that can serve to drive us toward movement, thought, and ever-changing forms of relation. As Lauren Berlant explores \u201ccruel optimism,\u201d Brian Massumi theorizes the affective logic of public threat, and Elspeth Probyn examines shame, they, along with the other contributors, show how an awareness of affect is opening up exciting new insights in disciplines from anthropology, cultural studies, geography, and psychology to philosophy, queer studies, and sociology. In essays diverse in subject matter, style, and perspective, the contributors demonstrate how affect theory illuminates the intertwined realms of the aesthetic, the ethical, and the political as they play out across bodies (human and non-human) in both mundane and extraordinary ways. They reveal the broad theoretical possibilities opened by an awareness of affect as they reflect on topics including ethics, food, public morale, glamor, snark in the workplace, and mental health regimes. The Affect Theory Reader includes an interview with the cultural theorist Lawrence Grossberg and an afterword by the anthropologist Kathleen Stewart. In the introduction, the editors suggest ways of defining affect, trace the concept\u2019s history, and highlight the role of affect theory in various areas of study. Contributors.

        "summary": "In this lively and accessible book, Augusto Ferraiuolo examines the many religious festivals in the Italian American community of Boston's North End. Using interviews, participant observation, and visual data, Ferraiuolo creates a vivid picture of how, over the course of a summer season, a number of religious festive practices are organized by multiple, overlapping, and, to some extent, competing voluntary organizations. The central argument that emerges is that the community uses these festivals, in part, to help maintain and establish a variety of identities, and that these identities are multistranded, complex, shifting, and negotiated--and thus ephemeral. In addition, Ferraiuolo shows in detail how individuals negotiate and construct identities as Italian Americans, Scaccianesi, Neapolitans, Catholics, and others, within the context of these celebrations. He also introduces a creative and original metaphor for understanding the ways in which selfhood is constructed, arguing that contemporary identities function as hypertext, in the manner of web-based technologies, linking to one another and building upon each other as constantly evolving \"technologies of the self.\""

        "summary": "\"The 2020 murder of George Floyd rocked nearly every aspect of American life and brought issues of police brutality to the forefront of public discourse. In the wake of his death and under extreme public pressure, many politicians, police chiefs, and court officials acknowledged the existence of systemic inequality in the fields of policing and criminal justice. However, with few exceptions, one actor within the justice system remained painfully silent: prosecutors. Progressive Prosecution both argues that this group should be at the forefront of calls for criminal justice reform and provides a guidebook for how this can be achieved. To date, little has been written that offers real guidance to District Attorneys and their staffs to help them shape a new culture within their offices dedicated to race-conscious practices and even-handed approaches. And even less has been written to educate a broader audience about the importance of a race-sensitive, community-based prosecution function in making real change in the criminal justice system and moving toward real justice. Progressive Prosecution offers both through a curated collection of chapters written by criminal justice experts and practicing District Attorneys focused on those components of prosecution policy and practice that deserve and demand radical rethinking. The book puts forth a radical new vision of prosecution: prosecutors must redefine the future of the criminal justice system\"--"

        "summary": "Persecution of Christians in the Middle East has been a recurring theme since the middle of the nineteenth century. The topic has experienced a resurgence in the last few years, especially during the Trump era. Middle Eastern Christians are often portrayed as a homogeneous, helpless group ever at the mercy of their Muslim enemies, a situation that only Western powers can remedy. The Politics of Persecution revisits this narrative with a critical eye. Mitri Raheb charts the plight of Christians in the Middle East from the invasion of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799 to the so-called Arab Spring. The book analyzes the diverse socioeconomic and political factors that led to the diminishing role and numbers of Christians in Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan during the eras of Ottoman, French, and British Empires, through the eras of independence, Pan-Arabism, and Pan-Islamism, and into the current era of American empire. With an incisive expos\u00e9 of the politics that lie behind alleged concerns for these persecuted Christians--and how the concept of persecution has been a tool of public diplomacy and international politics--Raheb reveals that Middle Eastern Christians have been repeatedly sacrificed on the altar of Western national interests. The West has been part of the problem for Middle Eastern Christianity and not part of the solution, from the massacre on Mount Lebanon to the rise of ISIS. The Politics of Persecution, written by a well-known Palestinian Christian theologian, provides an insider perspective on this contested region. Middle Eastern Christians survived successive empires by developing great elasticity in adjusting to changing contexts; they learned how to survive atrocities and how to resist creatively while maintaining a dynamic identity. In this light, Raheb casts the history of Middle Eastern Christians not so much as one of persecution but as one of resilience."

        "summary": "A richly detailed history of Britain at its imperial zenith, revealing the simmering tensions and explosive rivalries beneath the opulent surface of the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. The popular memory of Britain in the years before the Great War is of a powerful, contented, orderly, and thriving country. Britain commanded a vast empire: she bestrode international commerce. Her citizens were living longer, profiting from civil liberties their grandparents only dreamed of and enjoying an expanding range of comforts and pastimes. The mood of pride and self-confidence can be seen in Edward Elgar\u2019s Pomp and Circumstance marches, newsreels of George V\u2019s coronation, and London\u2019s great Edwardian palaces. Yet beneath the surface things were very different In The Age of Decadence, Simon Heffer exposes the contradictions of late-Victorian and Edwardian Britain. He explains how, despite the nation\u2019s massive power, a mismanaged war against the Boers in South Africa created profound doubts about her imperial destiny. He shows how attempts to secure vital social reforms prompted the twentieth century\u2019s gravest constitutional crisis\u2014and coincided with the worst industrial unrest in British history. He describes how politicians who conceded the vote to millions more men disregarded women so utterly that female suffragists\u2019 public protest bordered on terrorism. He depicts a ruling class that fell prey to degeneracy and scandal. He analyses a national psyche that embraced the motor-car, the sensationalist press, and the science fiction of H. G. Wells, but also the nostalgia of A. E. Housman."

These legal structures consist of access to the courts; 'legal stock' or the set of available standards and precedents on which to base litigation; and institutional receptiveness to potential litigation. These elements all depend on a variety of social, political, and economic variables. This book critically analyses the complexities of uniting human rights advocacy and environmental protection. Bringing together international experts in the field, it documents the current state of our environmental human rights knowledge, strategically critical questions that remain unanswered, and the initiatives required to develop those answers. It is ideal for researchers in environmental governance and law, as well as interested practitioners and advanced students working in public policy, political science and environmental studies."

Fan fiction plots like this are a strong testament of fans' endless creativity. Not only do the authors invent their own storylines but they have developed a generic definition of content across fandoms according to the relationship present in the text. Classification is therefore profoundly related to gender and sexuality. Julia Elena Goldmann examines these generic structures and formulaic patterns comparatively in Star Trek and Supernatural fan fiction. She also focuses on the interplay of the concepts of gender, sexuality, relationships and depictions of family in these texts."

From sex dolls to Siri, talking Barbies to the Bride of Frankenstein, Artificial Women explores the ways in which today's simulated females\u2014both real and fictional\u2014reflect and expose our own ideas about gender and female identity. Join Julie Wosk as she probes the realm of compliant sex workers, nurturing caretakers, genial servants, and rebellious creations in film, television, literature, art, photography, and current developments in robotics. These modern-day Galateas must embrace their own synthetic nature while also striving for authenticity and autonomy, all the while foregrounding gender stereotypes and changing perceptions of women and their roles. They embody the paradoxes and tensions that continue to arise in our increasingly simulated world, where the lines between the real and the virtual only continue to blur. As these \"artificial women\" become ever more lifelike, so too do the questions they raise become more provocative, and more illuminating of our own conceptions and conventions. Artificial Women pushes the boundaries of gender, sexuality, and culture studies to consider new digital technologies, artificial intelligences, and burgeoning simulations."

Systematically exploring every facet of Santeria\u2019s worldview, Sandoval examines how practitioners have adapted received beliefs and practices to reconcile them with new environments, from plantation slavery to exile in the United States. Offering a distinctive perspective based on a lifetime of extensive research and firsthand knowledge, Cros Sandoval illuminates Santer\u00eda as a theological system and as a vital, continuously evolving community. The adaptation process that gave birth to Santer\u00eda was not the singular result of cultural resistance, she argues, but a successful attempt to find meaning linked to alien religious elements in a way that appealed to a diverse following. Beginning with the transatlantic history of how Yoruba traditions came to Cuba and were established and adapted to Cuban society, Sandoval provides a comprehensive comparison of Yoruba and Cuban mythologies, followed by an overview of how Santer\u00eda has continued to diffuse and change in response to new contexts and adherents--with an especially illuminating perspective on Santer\u00eda among Cubans in Miami. As a reference work and historical treatment of Santer\u00eda, Sandoval\u2019s work will appeal to both scholars and nonscholars alike, ranging from anthropologists and students of religion and the African Diaspora to psychologists, social workers, and those curious about or inspired by this remarkably durable and adaptable belief system."

        "summary": "Corita Kent's photographs of vernacular inspiration--from street signs and folk art to kites, parades and fairs Corita Kent, formerly Sister Mary Corita, is known for her exuberant, colorful serigraphs and her teaching, as evidenced in her lively art classes. As a Catholic nun from 1936 until 1968, Corita lived and worked in the Immaculate Heart of Mary community in Los Angeles. She taught lettering and layout, image finding, and art structure for 20 years in Immaculate Heart College's art department. There, she screened multiple films simultaneously, hosted guest thinkers including Saul Bass, Buckminster Fuller and John Cage, and guided the making of large-scale collaborative projects with students. Corita regularly took her students out for looking sessions at a used car lot or an art exhibition. While constantly looking and discovering visually, Corita shot thousands of 35 mm slides documenting references, the IHC milieu and the art department processes. For Corita, the vernacular environs of advertising, supermarkets and the city's media landscape were a source of inspiration and raw material. Her slide collection encompasses a wide range of subjects: cookies, coke bottles, toys, presents, experiments, projects, Mary's Day celebrations stemming from Corita's classroom, flowers, magazines, seeds, puppets, visits with Charles and Ray Eames, street signs, trade fairs, folk art, boxes, billboards and kites. Drawing from the Corita Art Center's vast slide collection, Ordinary Things Will Be Signs for Us embodies Corita's philosophy of looking. Corita Kent (1918-86) was known for her iconic art, innovative teaching methods and messages of social justice. Born Frances Elizabeth Kent in Fort Dodge, Iowa, she entered the order of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Hollywood at age 18. As a professor and later chair of the art department, she helped establish its reputation as a hub of creativity and liberal thinking. By 1968, her art was enormously popular, showing in more than 230 exhibitions and held in public and private collections around the world. She remained active in social causes until her death in 1986."

Documenting the eponymous exhibition, Designing the Computational Image, Imagining Computational Design explores this period of remarkable inventiveness and traces its repercussions on architecture and other creative fields through the work of computational architects, designers, and artists working today. Alongside a compelling visual archive showcasing hundreds of unpublished or lesser-known computational images, drawings, films, and software, the book features essays by architecture, media, and science and technology scholars offering close readings of specific images, as well as conversations and interviews with historical protagonists and contemporary practitioners. Together, these materials illuminate in unprecedented detail the confluence of technical innovations in software, geometry, and hardware with a fledging technological imaginary of design and creativity, tracing the emergence -- and reimagining the potentials -- of a vibrant field of interdisciplinary research and practice."

Pentagram: Living by Design (two volumes) is the definitive statement on 50 years of Pentagram. This is an in-depth survey of the group from its beginnings in 1970s London to its current status as one of the powerhouses of international design. Book one, The Biography, offers a comprehensive analysis of the group, its partners, its achievements, its multidisciplinary approach, and its unique business model. This is accompanied by a plethora of images (some never published), a visual essay of Pentagram's work across four main sectors, a selection of partners writings, a Pentagram family tree, and much more. Book two, The Directory, has profiles of 50 partners, past and present, accompanied by extensive coverage of their work. It's a stellar roll call: from the five famous founders to some of the most celebrated names in contemporary design. It also includes a list of everyone who worked in the firm's various offices. Both books are designed by Tony Brook and the Spin design team and use a range of paper stocks and special colours."

The essays engage in the work of thinking through words to generate a conceptual vocabulary that will allow for a global conversation on social theory that will be necessarily multilingual. With essays by scholars, across generations, and from a variety of disciplines - history, anthropology, and philosophy to literature and political theory - this book will be essential reading for scholars, researchers and students of critical theory and the social sciences\"--"

        "summary": "\"In 1836, an enslaved six-year-old girl named Med was brought to Boston by a woman from New Orleans who claimed her as property. Learning of the girl's arrival in the city, the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS) waged a legal fight to secure her freedom and affirm the free soil of Massachusetts. While Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw ruled quite narrowly in the case that enslaved people brought to Massachusetts could not be held against their will, BFASS claimed a broad victory for the abolitionist cause, and Med was released to the care of a local institution. When she died two years later, celebration quickly turned to silence, and her story was soon forgotten. As a result, Commonwealth v. Aves is little known outside of legal scholarship. In this book, Karen Woods Weierman complicates Boston's identity as the birthplace of abolition and the cradle of liberty, and restores Med to her rightful place in antislavery history by situating her story in the context of other writings on slavery, childhood, and the law\"--"

        "summary": "When Jim Botticelli launched the Dirty Old Boston Facebook page as a salute to the gritty city of his past, he unwittingly galvanized thousands of people who were also nostalgic for and curious about this crucial time in the city's development. Now captured in a rich and compelling collection, Dirty Old Boston chronicles the people, streets, and buildings from the postwar years to 1987, when a new wave of transformation began. Along with the ball games and dive bars, the four decades covered in this book document some of the city's most dramatic changes and tumultuous events--wholesale razing of neighborhoods, Boston's busing crisis, and the continual fight for affordable housing.Photographs are drawn from family albums, student photography projects, institutional archives, and professional collections, revealing a view of Boston shot from the street. What emerges is a narrative of a city tearing down and rebuilding, protesting and celebrating, fading and thriving. Illuminating Boston's singular tenacity and spirit, Dirty Old Boston presents her proud moments and doesn't shy away from her growing pains. Dirty Old Boston recalls the city as it used to be, the challenges it faced, the maddening traffic and outlandish politics, the simple pleasures of block parties and parades, and those neighborhood haunts where people found camaraderie amidst it all. Raw and beautiful, this book is a tribute to a city and its people."

        "summary": "A literary and cultural history of coral--as an essential element of the marine ecosystem, a personal ornament, a global commodity, and a powerful political metaphor Today, coral and the human-caused threats to coral reef ecosystems symbolize our ongoing planetary crisis. In the nineteenth century, coral represented something else; as a recurring motif in American literature and culture, it shaped popular ideas about human society and politics. In Coral Lives, Michele Currie Navakas tells the story of coral as an essential element of the marine ecosystem, a cherished personal ornament, a global commodity, and a powerful political metaphor. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including works by such writers as Sarah Josepha Hale, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, and George Washington Cable, Navakas shows how coral once helped Americans to recognize both the potential and limits of interdependence--to imagine that their society could grow, like a coral reef, by sustaining rather than displacing others. Navakas shows how coral became deeply entwined with the histories of slavery, wage labor, and women's reproductive and domestic work. If coral seemed to some nineteenth-century American writers to be a metaphor for a truly just collective society, it also showed them, by analogy, that society can seem most robust precisely when it is in fact most unfree for the laborers sustaining it. Navakas's trailblazing cultural history reveals that coral has long been conceptually indispensable to humans, and its loss is more than biological. Without it, we lose some of our most complex political imaginings, recognitions, reckonings, and longings."

The focus is on spirituality, medicine and healing from a lived religion perspective. Besides a geographical focus on the Nordic countries and their characteristics, this collection examines the embodied practices aligned with different expressions of religiosity, alternative medicine, spirituality and healing practices. By addressing questions about how so-called Eastern practices are embodied, spread and materialized, the contributors shed light on a cultural change in Nordic societies regarding religious, spiritual and alternative health practices, that are sometimes at odds with the dominant medical discourse about life-threatening diseases and other types of conditions."

        "summary": "Persecution of Christians in the Middle East has been a recurring theme since the middle of the nineteenth century. The topic has experienced a resurgence in the last few years, especially during the Trump era. Middle Eastern Christians are often portrayed as a homogeneous, helpless group ever at the mercy of their Muslim enemies, a situation that only Western powers can remedy. The Politics of Persecution revisits this narrative with a critical eye. Mitri Raheb charts the plight of Christians in the Middle East from the invasion of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799 to the so-called Arab Spring. The book analyzes the diverse socioeconomic and political factors that led to the diminishing role and numbers of Christians in Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan during the eras of Ottoman, French, and British Empires, through the eras of independence, Pan-Arabism, and Pan-Islamism, and into the current era of American empire. With an incisive expos\u00e9 of the politics that lie behind alleged concerns for these persecuted Christians--and how the concept of persecution has been a tool of public diplomacy and international politics--Raheb reveals that Middle Eastern Christians have been repeatedly sacrificed on the altar of Western national interests. The West has been part of the problem for Middle Eastern Christianity and not part of the solution, from the massacre on Mount Lebanon to the rise of ISIS. The Politics of Persecution, written by a well-known Palestinian Christian theologian, provides an insider perspective on this contested region. Middle Eastern Christians survived successive empires by developing great elasticity in adjusting to changing contexts; they learned how to survive atrocities and how to resist creatively while maintaining a dynamic identity. In this light, Raheb casts the history of Middle Eastern Christians not so much as one of persecution but as one of resilience."

        "summary": "The global economy is at a crossroads. Can finance fix it? Proponents of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing say yes. They claim that new financial strategies that consider all stakeholders are essential tools for addressing runaway carbon emissions and stark income inequality, among other ills. ESG-integrated investments already encompass more than $120 trillion in financial assets. Is this approach really leading to better social and environmental outcomes for all? If not, how can it be improved? In Sustainable, a finance-industry veteran offers an insider's look at the promises, prospects, and limitations of ESG investing and provides comprehensive solutions that would promote more optimal outcomes. Terrence Keeley argues that both activist and C-suite advocates have been overly optimistic about what ESG can accomplish. Divestment threats are ineffective tools for altering corporate behavior, and verifiably \"good\" companies do not systematically generate great returns. Most importantly, business and finance cannot achieve inclusive, sustainable growth on their own: regulators, public policies, civil society, and individuals must all play specific, complementary roles to shape the future we need. In particular, Keeley recommends reallocating capital from indexed ESG products toward an emerging class of strategies with more verifiable social and environmental benefits. He identifies alternative \"impact investing\" strategies that can generate true double bottom lines. The book also highlights organizations that promote inclusive, sustainable economic growth. Proposing practical and actionable solutions to social and environmental problems, Sustainable offers an incisive vision of the roles business and finance can play in building a flourishing society."

        "summary": "From New Yorker staff writer and author of The Longing for Less Kyle Chayka comes a timely history and investigation of a world ruled by algorithms, which determine the shape of culture itself. From coffee shops to rental apartments to social media posts the world round, a sleek and deceptively simple aesthetic has come to predominate. It's in the neon signs and exposed brick of an Internet cafe in Nairobi or the skeletal, modern furniture of an Airbnb in Portland. These designs are easy to identify, but even more crucially, they photograph well. In their simplicity and studied airiness, these images fit seamlessly into the Instagram grid. But this aesthetic is only one small aspect of a broader program of curation that is determined by the algorithm--a network of mathematically determined choices that ramify into the development of city grids and music playlists alike. To have our tastes, behaviors, and emotions governed by computers, does nothing short of call the very notion of free will into question. Over the last decade, Kyle Chayka has studied the homogeneity of this curation of reality. Working as a contributor for The New Yorker, The New York Times Magazine, and The New Republic, he has traveled to Berlin, Reykjavik, and Los Angeles tracing the algorithm's lineage. In Filterworld, Chayka lucidly examines how this deeply filtered aesthetic--spanning digital and physical spaces--creates an uncanny blend of work, home, and social life. As the algorithm determines our choices, other important questions arise: What happens when shareability supersedes messiness, innovation, and creativity--the very nature of being human? What does the notion of choice mean when the available options have been so carefully arranged for us? Filterworld offers a way out. Kyle Chayka shows us how to disconnect from the tyranny of the algorithms that continue to override our sensibilities, and inform even our most intimate, real-world interactions. Most importantly, he shows us how to reclaim our individual freedom."

Looking beyond technical fixes, it further draws on economics, politics, and sociology to explore how modern technology can contribute to effective and socially just sustainability transitions. Examining cutting-edge research on energy, transport and industry, this Handbook argues that we have the technologies and policy instruments needed to mitigate and adapt to climate change, however, for larger-scale implementation the support at the socio-economic and political levels has to be increased. Chapters further analyse the role that technology plays in key sectors, such as agriculture and forestry, becoming more sustainable. Contributors also reflect on the position of technology in society, illustrating the wider socio-technical systems that determine the impact new technologies can have. They call for the political will to implement and scale up technological measures to address climate change across the world. The Handbook on Climate Change and Technology will be essential reading for academics and students of climate change, energy, sustainability, and environmental governance and regulation. It will also be an invaluable resource for practitioners and policy-makers seeking a deeper understanding of the role of technology in sustainability transitions."

Visually arresting illustrations and engaging texts place the novel\u2019s protagonist squarely in the middle of the twentieth-century debate on the relationship between technology and culture. The novel is divided into three chapters that trace the evolution of the Bauhaus, as its center moved across Germany\u2014from Weimar to Dessau to Berlin\u2014and as its philosophy responded to this economically, politically and intellectually highly charged era in Europe. Sergio Varbella\u2019s inventive drawings bring to life the theories of founder Walter Gropius, as well as the basic design ideals of unity and equity. Valentina Grande\u2019s thoughtful texts highlight crucial moments within the movement\u2019s history and in the lives of principal figures such as Klee, Kandinsky, Albers, and Mies van der Rohe. The perfect introduction to a radical but highly influential chapter in the history of design, this novel shows how the Bauhaus school broke down barriers and built up ideals that are still applied today."

        "summary": "The Black Experience in Design spotlights teaching practices, research, stories, and conversations from a Black/African diasporic lens. Excluded from traditional design history and educational canons that heavily favor European modernist influences, the work and experiences of Black designers have been systematically overlooked in the profession for decades. However, given the national focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the aftermath of the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, educators, practitioners, and students now have the opportunity\u2014as well as the social and political momentum\u2014to make long-term, systemic changes in design education, research, and practice, reclaiming the contributions of Black designers in the process. The Black Experience in Design, an anthology centering a range of perspectives, spotlights teaching practices, research, stories, and conversations from a Black/African diasporic lens. Through the voices represented, this text exemplifies the inherently collaborative and multidisciplinary nature of design, providing access to ideas and topics for a variety of audiences, meeting people as they are and wherever they are in their knowledge about design. Ultimately, The Black Experience in Design serves as both inspiration and a catalyst for the next generation of creative minds tasked with imagining, shaping, and designing our future."

        "summary": "Union Pacific Railroad's Averell Harriman had a bold vision to restore rail passenger traffic decimated by the Great Depression: create ski tourism in Idaho's remote Wood River Valley. A $1.5 million investment opened Sun Valley in December 1936 with a lavish lodge, luxury shopping, Austrian ski instructors and extensive backcountry skiing. Prestigious tournaments featured the world's best skiers. Chairlifts invented by Union Pacific engineers serviced skiers quickly and comfortably. Ski instructor and filmmaker Otto Lang recalled that seemingly overnight, it became \"a magnet for the 'beautiful people,' a meeting place for movie stars and moguls, chairmen and captains of industry, Greek shipping tycoons, and peripatetic playboys--and playgirls--of the international social set.\" After World War II and Harriman's departure, Union Pacific's willingness to pay the $500,000 yearly subsidy waned. Bill Janss purchased it in 1964 and reimagined it as a year-round resort but lacked the capital for growth. Sinclair Oil owners Earl and Carol Holding acquired it in 1977, revitalizing it into a premier resort with international status. Award-winning ski historian John W. Lundin celebrates America's first destination ski resort using unpublished Union Pacific documents, oral histories, contemporaneous accounts and more than 150 historic images."

        "summary": "Dedicated to the tracing of continuity across sectarian divides, Christopher Tadgell's History of Architecture in India (1989) was the first modern monograph to draw together in one volume all the strands of India's pre-colonial architectural history - from the Vedic and Native traditions of early India, through Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic and secular architecture. This comprehensive revision, Architecture in the Indian Subcontinent: From the Mauryas to the Mughals, expands the structure to acknowledge the great advance in scholarship across this extremely complex subject over the last three decades. An understanding of Indian history and religion is the basis for understanding the complex pattern of relationships in the evolution of architecture in the subcontinent. Therefore, background material covers major invasions, migrations, dynastic conflicts and cultural and commercial connections, the main religious developments and their significance and repercussions, and external architectural precedents. While avoiding the usual division of the subject into 'Buddhist and Hindu' and 'Islamic' parts in order to trace continuity, the importance of religion, symbolism and myth to the development of characteristic Indian architectural forms in all their richness and complexity is fully explained in this fully illustrated account of the subcontinent's architecture."

He is the \"divine messenger,\" central to the understanding of Yoruba religion and worldview, as well as their various manifestations and related orisa traditions in the African diaspora--such as Candombl\u00e9, Vodou, and Santer\u00eda/Lukumi. Esu and Ifa (divination with all its sacred texts) or Orunmila (the god of divination) rank as the most widespread and the most worshipped of all the deities. Both Esu and Ifa/Orunmila hold the Yoruba cosmic system together. Esu is now part of what some may label as the Black Atlantic religion; part of the attempt to recover African religions in other lands; as well as part of the use of religion for survival. As the book points out, in Esu's ability to migrate to other lands, he becomes part of transatlantic history, but more so of the tension between relocation and history, between the violence that led to the forced migrations of people and the long healing process of reconciliation with living in strange lands that later became new homelands. This book is part of the African World Series, edited by Toyin Falola, Jacob and Frances Sanger Mossiker Chair in the Humanities, University of Texas at Austin."

        "summary": "This book explores the changing tactics, technologies and terrains of 21st century war. It argues that the world in 2049 is unlikely to look like the climate change/AI dystopia depicted in Blade Runner 2049, but nor will it be a world where conflict and war has been transformed by a 'civilizing process' that eradicates violence and conflict from the human condition. 2049 is also the year that the US Department of Defense has suggested China will become a world-shaping military power. All states will be engaged in 'arms races' across a variety of new tools and technologies - from drones, robotics, AI and quantum computing - that will transform politics, economy, society and war. Drawing on thinkers such as Zygmunt Bauman and Paul Virilio, the book suggests that future war will be shaped by three broad tendencies that include a broad range of tactics, technologies and trends; the Impure, the Granular and the Machinic. Through discussions of cybersecurity, urban war, robotics, AI, climate change, science fiction and new strategic concepts, it examines how these tendencies might evolve in the different geopolitical futures and types of war ahead of us. The book provides a thought-provoking and distinctive framework through which to think about the changing character of war. It concludes that for all the novel and dangerous challenges ahead, the futuristic possibilities of warfare will likely continue to be shaped by problems familiar to students of international relations and the history of war - albeit problems that will play out in geopolitical and technological contexts that we have never encountered before. This book will be of much interest to students of critical war studies, security studies, science and technology studies, and International Relations in general."

        "summary": "This book analyses how digital transformation disrupts established patterns of world politics, moving International Relations (IR) increasingly towards Digital International Relations. This volume examines technological, agential and ordering processes that explain this fundamental change. The contributors trace how digital disruption changes the international world we live in, ranging from security to economics, from human rights advocacy to deep fakes, and from diplomacy to international law. The book makes two sets of contributions. First, it shows that the ongoing digital revolution profoundly changes every major dimension of international politics. Second, focusing on the interplay of technology, agency and order, it provides a framework for explaining these changes. The book also provides a map for adjusting the study of international politics to studying International Relations, making a case for upgrading, augmenting and rewiring the discipline. Theory follows practice in International Relations, but if the discipline wants to be able to meaningfully analyse the present and come up with plausible scenarios for the future, it must not lag too far behind major transformations of the world that it studies. This book facilitates that theoretical journey. This book will be of much interest to students of cyber-politics, politics and technology, and International Relations."

Learn how contemporary designers, including Petra Blaisse, Bruce Mau, Malin+Goetz and many others, engage sensory experience. Multisensory design can solve problems and enhance life for everyone, including those with sensory disabilities. Featuring thematic essays on topics ranging from design for the table to tactile graphics, tactile sound, and visualizing the senses, this book is a call to action for multisensory design practice. The Senses: Design Beyond Vision is mandatory reading for students and professionals working in diverse fields, including products, interiors, graphics, interaction, sound, animation, and data visualization, or anyone seeking the widest possible understanding of design. The book, designed by David Genco with Ellen Lupton, is edited by Lupton and curator Andrea Lipps. Includes essays by Lupton, Lipps, Christopher Brosius, Hansel Bauman, Karen Kraskow, Binglei Yan, and Simon Kinnear."

Excluded from traditional design history and educational canons that heavily favor European modernist influences, the work and experiences of Black designers have been systematically overlooked in the profession for decades. However, given the national focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the aftermath of the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, educators, practitioners, and students now have the opportunity\u2014as well as the social and political momentum\u2014to make long-term, systemic changes in design education, research, and practice, reclaiming the contributions of Black designers in the process. The Black Experience in Design, an anthology centering a range of perspectives, spotlights teaching practices, research, stories, and conversations from a Black/African diasporic lens. Through the voices represented, this text exemplifies the inherently collaborative and multidisciplinary nature of design, providing access to ideas and topics for a variety of audiences, meeting people as they are and wherever they are in their knowledge about design. Ultimately, The Black Experience in Design serves as both inspiration and a catalyst for the next generation of creative minds tasked with imagining, shaping, and designing our future."

There are many: planners, developers, investors, contractors, special-interest groups, governments from local to national, and above all in this book, designers. The complex sets of relationships in which the designer is enmeshed remain largely unknown, as does the effect of those relationships on the public spaces they design. In \"super-diverse\" cities like London, a successful public realm, where people can be together in trust and tolerance, is essential. A city's commitment to design quality indicates a commitment to civic health. In the interests of such commitment, the book asks: What should public space \"design intentions\" be today?; Who is \"the public\" of public spaces?; What can/should designers do to protect the \"publicness\" of public spaces?; Was state financed public space mid-20th century of any higher quality than privately financed public space today?; How significant is the shift from commissioning architects to design public spaces mid-20th century to commissioning landscape architects and public realm architects today?; Does emptiness in public spaces have a value?; Does retail in public spaces narrow the range of people visiting them?"

It has become an even more important topic in the last decades, as 45 or so states have adopted lottery laws and there are national lotteries like Powerball and Mega Millions. The federal statutes that affect lotteries include those: under the criminal code; covering participation by national banks in lotteries; dealing with the role of the post office; and governing false representations. The guide will cover both state statutory and administrative law references as well as secondary sources such as encyclopedias, practice books, treatises, law reviews and legal periodicals, websites, and blogs.--Publisher."

Three points to highlight are: this edition is revised chapter by chapter; includes new contributors; and features new illustrations and appendices. This book is designed specifically for California legal research. It is not designed for a California lawyer who practices in Federal Courts or in other state jurisdictions. From the first edition this title has started out with a short overview of the legal research process and then carried that process into the different types of resources that are used in California research: constitutions, statutes, cases, regulations, local government sources, the attorney general, the state bar, law libraries, legal education, and all different types of secondary sources. The legal resources are addressed from both an historical and a current-use perspective. The resources are covered in their print and other alternative formats. The appendices have always given the user helpful bibliographies, charts, directories, and lists of governors, justices, law schools, law libraries, and vendors.--Publisher."

This book describes various facets of the Organization, focusing on primary institutions involved in governance, the division of powers among its organs, and policy outcomes that impact regional stakeholders. Moreover, the basic objective of the book is to provide an explanation of the OAS, and the affirmation of four pillars--representative democracy, development, human rights, and security. Underscoring these pillars are efforts to minimize conflict in the region through dialogue promoted within its organs and entities. Dialogue relies on a willingness of member states representatives to seek solutions to disputes in accord with the practices, purposes, and principles of the OAS.--Publisher."

Keynote speaker Fred Shapiro's paper \"The Most-Cited Legal Scholars Revisited\" sets the stage. The remaining chapters continue the impressive collection of first-rate scholarship from more than 20 authors from law schools across the country. This material advances the understanding of law librarianship and legal information management and encourages law librarians to continue to create and publish a body of scholarship. It also shows the intense interest of law school administrations and their alums and donors in rankings of scholarship (and although U.S. News & World Report made the decision not to pursue its Scholarly Impact Ranking, at least for now, the issue is far from settled).--Publisher."

With How to Meditate, the American-born Tibetan Buddhist nun presents her first book exploring in depth what she considers the essentials for a lifelong practice. More and more people are beginning to recognize a profound inner longing for authenticity, connection, and aliveness. Meditation, Pema explains, gives us a golden key to address this yearning. This step-by-step guide shows readers how to honestly meet and openly relate with the mind, embrace the fullness of our experience, and live in a wholehearted way as we discover: The basics of meditation, from getting settled and the six points of posture to working with your breath and cultivating an attitude of unconditional friendlinessThe Seven Delights\u2014how moments of difficulty can become doorways to awakening and loveShamatha (or calm abiding), the art of stabilizing the mind to remain present with whatever arisesThoughts and emotions as \u201csheer delight\u201d\u2014instead of obstacles\u2014in meditation \u201cI think ultimately why we practice is so that we can become completely loving people, and this is what the world needs,\u201d writes Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n.

Chris Funk combines the latest science with compelling stories, providing a timely, accessible, and beautifully-written synopsis of this critical topic. The book describes our unique and fragile Earth system, and the negative impacts humans are having on our support systems. It then examines recent disasters, including heat waves, extreme precipitation, hurricanes, fires, El Ni\u00e4nos and La Ni\u00e4nas, and their human consequences. By clearly describing the dangerous impacts that are already occurring, Funk provides a clarion call for social change, yet also conveys the beauty and wonder of our planet, and hope for our collective future\"--"

I became a reporter and editor, first at the Pacific Citizen, the national publication of the Japanese American Citizens League and then in Tokyo for the Japan Times. For the Pacific Citizen, I reported on civil rights, incidents of bias and interviewed politicians and leaders of the Japanese American community. At Japan Times, I was fortunate to interview Haruki Murakami on his thoughts of a changing Japan in the wake of the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo attack on the Tokyo subway system that left 13 dead. All along the way I have drawn cartoons. I've been extremely blessed to work with editors who have been open to my attempts at cartooning. I usually worked at night on a green cutting board that I purchased at a department store in Shibuya. So many years later, I still draw on that cutting board, although now the finishing work is done on computer.I returned from Tokyo to work in Little Tokyo. For more than 20 years I've been working as a reporter and editor in Little Tokyo at The Rafu Shimpo, a newspaper with more than 100 years of history chronicling the ups and downs of Japanese and Japanese American society. During my time as editor, I've reported on the changes in the JA community and Little Tokyo, both from the political perspective to the granular - profiles of storeowners, basketball kids and leaders who make Little Tokyo such a special neighborhood. I believe with all my heart that independent journalism connects and ties a community together and makes it stronger. Looking back, cartooning has been the constant and taken me places I would have never imagined as a little kid who hated to go to Saturday school to learn nihongo. It's been a fun journey, please come with me!"

        "summary": "A troubling account of heterosexual desire in the era of #MeToo Heterosexuality is in crisis. Reports of sexual harassment, misconduct, and rape saturate the news in the era of #MeToo. Straight men and women spend thousands of dollars every day on relationship coaches, seduction boot camps, and couple\u2019s therapy in a search for happiness. In The Tragedy of Heterosexuality, Jane Ward smartly explores what, exactly, is wrong with heterosexuality in the twenty-first century, and what straight people can do to fix it for good. She shows how straight women, and to a lesser extent straight men, have tried to mend a fraught patriarchal system in which intimacy, sexual fulfillment, and mutual respect are expected to coexist alongside enduring forms of inequality, alienation, and violence in straight relationships. Ward also takes an intriguing look at the multi-billion-dollar self-help industry, which markets goods and services to help heterosexual couples without addressing the root of their problems. Ultimately, she encourages straight men and women to take a page out of queer culture, reminding them \u201cabout the human capacity to desire, fuck, and show respect at the same time.\u201d"

        "summary": "\"The title of this book would have made little sense to me when I chose to be a history major nearly five decades ago. I might perhaps have thought it an analysis of linguistic developments, as gender was something I considered (and bemoaned) largely when learning German nouns. The women's movement changed that, as it changed so much else. The feminist movement that began in the 1960s - often termed the \"second wave\" to set it apart from the \"first wave\" of feminism that began in the nineteenth century - included a wide range of political beliefs, with various groups working for a broad spectrum of goals, one of which was to understand more about the lives of women in the past. This paralleled a similar rise of interest in women's history that accompanied the first wave of feminism. Women's and Gender History Advocates of women's rights in the present, myself included, looked at what we had been taught about the past - as well as what we had been taught about literature, psychology, religion, biology, and most other disciplines - and realized we were only hearing half the story. Most of the studies we read or heard described the male experience - \"man the artist,\" \"man the hunter,\" \"man and his environment\" - though they often portrayed it as universal. We began to investigate the lives of women in the past, asserting that any investigation of past power relationships had to include discussion of patriarchy, that predominant social system in which men have more power and access to resources than women of the same group, and in which some men are privileged over other men and some women over other women\"--"

For as long as she can remember, Belle has been insidiously obsessed with her skin and skincare videos. When her estranged mother Noelle mysteriously dies, Belle finds herself back in Southern California, dealing with her mother\u2019s considerable debts and grappling with lingering questions about her death. The stakes escalate when a strange woman in red appears at the funeral, offering a tantalizing clue about her mother\u2019s demise, followed by a cryptic video about a transformative spa experience. With the help of a pair of red shoes, Belle is lured into the barbed embrace of La Maison de M\u00e9duse, the same lavish, culty spa to which her mother was devoted. There, Belle discovers the frightening secret behind her (and her mother\u2019s) obsession with the mirror\u2014and the great shimmering depths (and demons) that lurk on the other side of the glass. Snow White meets Eyes Wide Shut in this surreal descent into the dark side of beauty, envy, grief, and the complicated love between mothers and daughters. With black humor and seductive horror, Rouge explores the cult-like nature of the beauty industry\u2014as well as the danger of internalizing its pitiless gaze. Brimming with California sunshine and blood-red rose petals, Rouge holds up a warped mirror to our relationship with mortality, our collective fixation with the surface, and the wondrous, deep longing that might lie beneath."

        "summary": "A product of twenty-five years of archival and primary research, Sounding Our Way Home: Japanese American Musicking and the Politics of Identity narrates the efforts of three generations of Japanese Americans to reach \"home\" through musicking. Using ethnomusicology as a lens, Susan Miyo Asai examines the musical choices of a population that, historically, is considered outside the racial and ethnic boundaries of American citizenship. Emphasizing the notion of national identity and belonging, the volume provokes a discussion about the challenges of nation-building in a democratic society. Asai addresses the politics of music, interrogating the ways musicking functions as a performance of social, cultural, and political identification for Japanese Americans in the United States. Musicking is an inherently political act at the intersection of music, identity, and politics, particularly if it involves expressing one's ethnicity and/or race. Asai further investigates how Japanese American ethnic identification and cultural practices relate to national belonging. Musicking cultivates a narrative of a shared history and aesthetic between performers and listeners. The discourse situates not only Japanese Americans, but all Asians into the black/white binary of race relations in the United States. Sounding Our Way Home contributes to the ongoing struggle for acceptance and equal representation for people of color in the US. A history of Japanese American musicking across three generations, the book unveils the social and political discrimination that nonwhite immigrants and their offspring continue to face when it comes to finding acceptance in US society and culture."

        "summary": "Born in a time of anxiety, Words and Worlds examines some of the disquieting challenges that societies now face. Through an inquiry into a political lexicon of commonsense words, ranging from democracy and revolution to knowledge and authority, from inequality and toleration to war and power, the contributors to this book trouble the self-evidence of these terms, bringing into view the hidden transcripts and unexpected trajectories of many settled ideas, such as the human sense of belonging or the call for openness and transparency in research and public life. The case studies conducted over five continents with the tools of eight different disciplines challenge the ethnocentric assumptions, false moralism, and cultural prejudices that underlie much discussion on corruption or even the virtue invested in resilience. The critique of the ubiquitous use of crisis to characterize our times shows how this framing obscures the unjust conditions of existence and the violence of everyday life. Together the essays in this volume offer a fresh look at the deeply connected worlds we inhabit in solidarity and in discord. Contributors.

        "summary": "This Handbook provides new theoretical and empirical insights into men, men's practices and masculinities across many kinds of organizations and forms of organizing. Most mainstream studies of organizations, leadership and management do not seem to notice they are often talking a lot about men and masculinities. The Handbook challenges this general tendency to avoid gendering men by bringing together a range of theoretical and methodological approaches that: engage with not only formal organizations, such as businesses and state organizations, but also processes of organizing within and beyond organizations; address emergent and future issues on men, masculinities and organizations, such as tech masculinities, men's emotions, sexualities and violences, animal advocacy and environmental issues, and men and masculinities in pandemics. Targeted at scholars, policy-makers, practitioners and students interested in links between men, masculinities, organizations and organizing, this landmark Handbook is an invaluable resource for those working in and beyond such fields as gender studies, organization, leadership and management studies, political science, sociology, social and public policy, social movement studies."

        "summary": "One young woman's correspondence with her community's servicemen, maintaining connection and boosting morale throughout the Civil War During the American Civil War, soldiers frequently wrote letters to friends and family members as a way of maintaining their connections to loved ones at home. However, most of the published collections of Civil War letters contain correspondence between just two individuals. Letters to Lizzie: The Story of Sixteen Men in the Civil War and the One Woman Who Connected Them All contains a collection of letters exchanged between 16 men--15 soldiers and a quartermaster at a military hospital--and one young woman, Lizzie Brick. Since Lizzie herself could not bear arms, she took up her pen and through ongoing correspondence helped these Union soldiers sustain their motivation for the cause. The men served in 11 different regiments in the Army of the Potomac, and their correspondence reveals unique insights into the connections between home front and battlefront during the Civil War and into the dynamics of male-female friendships in the 19th century. The letters span the entire war, and within them, the soldiers share their opinions about the people of the South, describe their experiences on the battlefield, and voice their frustrations with their commanders and the conduct of the war. Letters to Lizzie presents a complex portrait of a young woman during wartime as well as the concerns of soldiers, thus contributing to our understanding of the connections between servicemen and their communities and the role that women played during the Civil War in sustaining these relationships."

        "summary": "This interdisciplinary anthology contributes to the contemporary dialogues about motherhood/mothering drawing attention to the experiences of motherhood/mothering both within medical practice as physicians as well as highlight motherhood/mothering experiences of medicine, examining both mothers as patients themselves and with their children as patients. As medical schools steadily increase the number of women studying medicine, research on mothers in medical practice would add to a better understanding on the different values, expectations, institutions and events that shape and define the identities within medicine. How does the increase of women as mothers practicing medicine affect the outcomes of mothers as patients? Does birthing your own child impact your practice? Does knowing your physician or your child's physician is a mother affect your experience as a patient or that of your child's? The edited volume will explore how relationships between motherhood/mothering experiences in/of medicine are presently being theorized, re-examined, negotiated, and most importantly, debated. This is an interdisciplinary volume which unites essays as well as creative submissions that engage with the issue of motherhood experiences in/of medicine, including works of fiction, creative non-fiction, in addition to traditional academic writing, allowing an open and innovative space for critical discussion."

        "summary": "An urgent exploration of why American neighborhoods are in trouble, and how to fix them, starting with the places we call home. The neighborhoods we live in impact our lives in so many ways: they determine who we know, what resources and opportunities we have access to, the quality of schools our kids go to, our sense of security and belonging, and even how long we live. Yet too many of us live in neighborhoods plagued by rising crime, school violence, family disintegration, addiction, alienation, and despair. Even the wealthiest neighborhoods are not immune; while poverty exacerbates these challenges, they exist in zip codes rich and poor, rural and urban, and everything in between. In Fragile Neighborhoods, fragile states expert Seth D. Kaplan offers a bold new vision for addressing social decline in America, one zip code at a time. By revitalizing our local institutions - and the social ties that knit them together - we can all turn our neighborhoods into places where people and families can thrive. Readers will meet the innovative individuals and organizations pioneering new approaches to everything from youth mentoring, to urban planning, to keeping families intact: people like Dreama, a former lawyer whose organization works with local leaders and educators in rural Appalachia to equip young people with the social support they need to succeed in school, and Chris, whose Detroit-based non-profit turns vacant school buildings into community resource hubs while also organizing local volunteers to repair homes and beautify streets in neighborhoods across the city. Along the way, Kaplan offers a set of practical lessons to inspire similar work, reminding us that when change is hyperlocal, everyone has the opportunity to contribute."

        "summary": "From the acclaimed author of The Black Minutes and Don't Send Flowers, How to Draw a Novel is an ingenious and visually stimulating exploration of narrative and craft from master storyteller and former publisher Mart\u00edn Solares In this finely wrought collection of essays, Mart\u00edn Solares examines the novel in all its forms, exploring the conventions of structure, the novel as a house that one must build brick by brick, and the objects and characters that build out the world of the novel in unique and complex ways. With poetic, graceful prose, that reflects the power of fascination with literary fiction, Solares uses line drawings to realize the ebb and flow of the novel, with Moby Dick spiraling across the page while Dracula takes the form of an erratic heartbeat. A novelist, occasional scholar, and former acquiring editor in Mexican publishing, Solares breaks out of the Anglo-American-dominated canon of many craft books, ranging across Latin and South America as well. He considers how writers invent (or discover) their characters, the importance of place (or not) in the novel, and the myriad of forms the novel may take. Solares' passion for the form is obvious, and his insights into the construction of the novel are as profound as they are accessible. This is a writer's book, and an important contribution to the study of craft and fiction."

        "summary": "The Routledge International Handbook of Juvenile Homicide is the definitive work on juvenile homicide. This volume provides an up-to-date, comprehensive, and in-depth exploration of what is known about juveniles involved in murder. Taking an interdisciplinary approach to juvenile homicide, this handbook brings together the leading experts in social sciences, mental health, and law from many countries. The volume covers the phenomenon of juvenile homicide from beginning to end, by addressing the questions \"Why do kids kill\" all the way to \"How does society stop them from killing\"? The tough issues involved in sentencing youths who take the lives of others, often deliberately and in horrific ways, are confronted through chapters addressing the legal issues, child development factors, risk assessment, public attitudes, and ethical concerns. The volume brings together research specifically conducted for this volume, in addition to summaries and discussions of clinical and empirical findings. Each chapter ends with key takeaway points. Contributors include psychologists, psychiatrists, criminologists, sociologists, lawyers, economists, biologists, epidemiologists, and public health and public policy experts. Uniquely, they examine murder by juveniles across the globe. The volume includes research pertaining to the causes, correlates, and theoretical explanations of juvenile homicide offending. Moving beyond discussions of juvenile homicide offenders (JHOs) as a homogenous group, the volume includes research on specific types of JHOs, and research investigating age and gender differences among JHOs. In addition, it draws attention to the empirical factors associated with juvenile homicide offending, effective treatment of JHOs, recidivism, and prevention of violent behavior. The volume also makes recommendations for policy and practice, including how to shift government policy from punishing lawbreakers to saving lives. This volume is essential reading for scholars and students researching youth violence/juvenile homicide across a variety of disciplines including criminology, criminal justice, law, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, social work, public health, and education. It is also an invaluable reference for mental health professionals, practitioners in the juvenile and criminal justice systems, policymakers, and government leaders."

        "summary": "\"Multinational Sources Compared\" 2nd ed., is a finding aid designed to direct researchers to sources most likely to cover 336 legal subjects and particular jurisdictions, with a fairly comprehensive list of resources available to researchers in either print or electronic formats. To enhance the usefulness and function of this resource, the entries include data points such as jurisdictions covered. The authors used the resource itself or a publisher's description to understand and briefly summarize/describe topical and jurisdictional coverage. Jurisdictional coverage of multinational resources is ephemeral, especially with the updating that takes places on various databases. To help keep this resource current, a stand-alone, fully searchable database in HeinOnline accompanies this print work. This database will be regularly updated, allowing for the addition of new resources, for updated jurisdictions, and for adding or modifying subjects as the law progresses. This new print edition continues to consult English-language legal information publishers and sift through their product offerings, adding publishers to the review list along the way. Many legacy titles are still updated and maintained (such as \"Trademarks Throughout the World\"), while others remain accessible to researchers in certain formats but are no longer updated (such as \"Domain Names: Global Practice and Procedure\"). Additionally, \"global guides\" are moving away from offering a traditional bound volume, to a flexible practitioner-written \"Q&A guide\" format. Also, this edition incorporates a growing category of materials: comparative monographs, which typically feature a collection of jurisdictional essays written on a specific and focused topic. It contains nearly 60 new subject headings added as needed over the last several database updates. Other updates are designed to make the work easier to use. For example, while the first edition began the author/editor field with the first author or editor's last name, the author/editor field in the second edition has been changed to conform with Rule 15 of The Bluebook (21st ed. 2021). Other updates include conforming the different types of monographs or supplements to the descriptor \"bound volume,\" and making the list of format types more consistent. Researchers will find this second edition, along with the stand-alone, fully searchable database in HeinOnline, helpful and useful.--Publisher."

        "summary": "Influential designer Harris Reed explores the world of gender-defying fashion in this richly illustrated monograph. In Fluid, revolutionary fashion designer Harris Reed introduces the world to a new era in fluid fashion. At the center of Reed's sartorial journey has always been his desire to change the way people express their identities through clothing. Fluidity's essence is adaptable, evolutionary, and dynamic, and Reed's work constantly disrupts the divide between men's and women's clothing. Reed's pieces have been worn by Harry Styles, Adele, Sam Smith, Iman, and Beyonc\u00e9, and with each piece, he has generated an instantly iconic cultural moment, pushing conversations about gender expression into the mainstream. Fluid examines historical antecedents of fluidity, questions old power structures, and urges people to find their authentic selves in this new avenue of fashion. With stunning color photography, resplendent fashion, and illustrations of Harris's design process, Fluid takes readers beyond the idea of clothes as mere garments, positing that clothes are a nexus of art, philosophy, and history that can be used to help shape our culture and challenge understandings of gender. With this book, Reed affirms that fluid is the future of fashion."

To meet the challenges of their work, they rely less on formulas learned in graduate school than on the kind of improvisation learned in practice. This unarticulated, largely unexamined process is the subject of Sch\u00f6n's provocatively original book, an effort to show precisely how reflection-in-action works and how this vital creativity might be fostered in future professionals."

Where previous histories have framed this process as an epochal spiritual conversion, The Mexican Mission widens the lens to examine its political and economic history, revealing a worldly enterprise that both remade and colonized Mesoamerica. The mission exerted immense temporal power in struggles over indigenous jurisdictions, resources, and people. Competing communities adapted the mission to their own designs; most notably, they drafted labor to raise ostentatious monastery complexes in the midst of mass death. While the mission fostered indigenous recovery, it also grounded Spanish imperial authority in the legitimacy of local native rule. The Mexican mission became one of the most extensive in early modern history, with influences reverberating on Spanish frontiers from New Mexico to Mindanao."

        "summary": "Facing the harrowing task of rebuilding a life in the wake of the Holocaust, many Jewish survivors, community and religious leaders, and Allied soldiers viewed marriage between Jewish women and military personnel as a way to move forward after unspeakable loss. Proponents believed that these unions were more than just a ticket out of war-torn Europe: they would help the Jewish people repopulate after the attempted annihilation of European Jewry. Historian Robin Judd, whose grandmother survived the Holocaust and married an American soldier after liberation, introduces us to the Jewish women who lived through genocide and went on to wed American, Canadian, and British military personnel after the war. She offers an intimate portrait of how these unions emerged and developed--from meeting and courtship to marriage and immigration to life in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom--and shows how they helped shape the postwar world by touching thousands of lives, including those of the chaplains who officiated their weddings, the Allied authorities whose policy decisions structured the couples' fates, and the bureaucrats involved in immigration and acculturation. The stories Judd tells are at once heartbreaking and restorative, and she vividly captures how the exhilaration of the brides' early romances coexisted with survivor's guilt, grief, and apprehension at the challenges of starting a new life of starting a new life in a new land."

        "summary": "The Mental Health of Gifted Intelligent Machines explores the increasingly sophisticated behaviours of developing AI and how we can ensure it will have emotional resilience, ethical strength and an ability to think in a new and enhanced way. Its primary aim is to change how we understand the world by investigating humanity as an intelligent being, examining and contrasting human and artificial intelligence. The book considers what we can learn from the likely mental health issues that will occur with increasingly sophisticated aspects of machine intelligence and how they will reflect the human condition. It asks questions about our identity in a deeply uncertain and disruptive ever-changing world; how we will improve and enhance our psychological intelligence to meet the increasing complications and demands of the future; and what we need to do, now, to be psychologically intelligent enough to live a full meaningful life in a new world evolving around us. The book argues that changes in our understanding of mental health, psychology and our view of intelligence will challenge huge aspects of our fundamental beliefs and assumptions and that it is essential we explore new arenas to further understand both our own human psychological issues and mental health as we develop gifted intelligent machines. It is a must read for all students, researchers and professionals involved with AI, gifted education, consciousness and mental health."

        "summary": "Combining empirical and theoretical approaches from a range of disciplines, Linguistic Identities in the Arab Gulf States examines current issues surrounding language and identity in the Arab Gulf States. Organized in four parts, the book addresses the overarching theme of 'waves of change' in relation to language and power, linguistic identities in the media, identities in transition, and language in education. The authors of each chapter are renowned experts in their field, and contribute to furthering our understanding of the dynamic, changeable, and socially constructed nature of identities and how identities are often intricately woven into and impacted by local and global developments. Although the book geographically covers Gulf region contexts, many of the concepts and dilemmas discussed are relevant to other highly diverse nations globally. For example, debates surrounding tolerance, diversity, neoliberal ideologies in English-medium instruction (EMI), media representation of language varieties, and sociolinguistic inequalities during Coronavirus communication are pertinent to regions outside the Gulf too. This volume will particularly appeal to students and scholars interested in issues around language and identity, gender, language policy and planning, multilingualism, translingual practice, language in education, and language ideologies."

Delving into the narratives enveloping the development of AI systems, with a particular emphasis on \"tech-giants\" and the ideas of Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Bill Gates, Arshin Adib-Moghaddam explains how and why technology aids and abets various forms of extremism, entrenches social hierarchies and discriminatory boundaries and how this will impact international security and human rights in the future."

The series comprises high quality monographs and collected volumes that address such issues. The topics in this series range from phonology to semantics, from syntax to information structure, from mathematical linguistics to studies of the lexicon."

        "summary": "Data science methods and tools\u2014including programming, data management, visualization, and machine learning\u2014and their application to neuroimaging research As neuroimaging turns toward data-intensive discovery, researchers in the field must learn to access, manage, and analyze datasets at unprecedented scales. Concerns about reproducibility and increased rigor in reporting of scientific results also demand higher standards of computational practice. This book offers neuroimaging researchers an introduction to data science, presenting methods, tools, and approaches that facilitate automated, reproducible, and scalable analysis and understanding of data. Through guided, hands-on explorations of openly available neuroimaging datasets, the book explains such elements of data science as programming, data management, visualization, and machine learning, and describes their application to neuroimaging. Readers will come away with broadly relevant data science skills that they can easily translate to their own questions. \u2022 Fills the need for an authoritative resource on data science for neuroimaging researchers \u2022 Strong emphasis on programming \u2022 Provides extensive code examples written in the Python programming language \u2022 Draws on openly available neuroimaging datasets for examples \u2022 Written entirely in the Jupyter notebook format, so the code examples can be executed, modified, and re-executed as part of the learning process"

        "summary": "Modern Jerusalem, a city central to Jewish, Muslim, and Christian religious imaginaries and the political epicenter of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, is to put it mildly a highly contested space. More surprising, perhaps, is that its musical landscape not only reflects these rifts but also helped to define them as the ancient city transitioned to modernity during the twentieth century. In City of Song: Music and the Making of Modern Jerusalem, author Michael A. Figueroa argues that musical renderings of Jerusalem have been critical to the formation of Israeli political consciousness. The book demonstrates how Israeli songwriters helped to shape their public's territorial imagination-- creating images of a city at once heavenly and earthly, that dwells in longing, that must not be forgotten, that compels one to bereave the dead, that represents the fulfilment of prophecy, and that is the site of immense cultural diversity. The dynamic history of its representation in lyrics and music helps dispel any notion that the Israeli-Palestinian crisis is timeless, intractable, and based on static, essential identities; while there are continuities across historical divides, radical change constantly transpires. City of Song combines analyses of musical meaning, political discourse, and public performance over the long twentieth century (1880s-2010) to reveal how the Israeli-Palestinian crisis' territorial fixation on Jerusalem has been constructed, historically contingent, and subject to artistic intervention in modernity. Through a musical history of Jerusalem, Figueroa introduces a novel, humanities-centered approach to one of the world's most contested cities, and one of the defining cultural and political questions of our era."

This focus on stillness, things that are stuck, incomplete or in a state of transition can point to new theoretical, methodological and practical dimensions in social studies of medicine. This edited volume brings the concept of immobility to the forefront of social studies of medicine to explore how immobility shapes processes of medical care and the theoretical and methodological challenges of studying immobility in medical contexts. The authors in this volume draw from a wide range of case studies across the globe to make contributions to our current understanding of health, illness and medicine, mobilities and immobilities.

Taking one theme per chapter, the book examines the social and environmental influences that shape people's health; health inequalities; poverty and health; mental, emotional and spiritual health; sexual health; physical inactivity; diet; tobacco; alcohol; drugs; weight; cardiovascular disease; cancer; diabetes and dementia. The book takes a holistic approach, combining scientific and epidemiological evidence with the subjective experiences of those who experience these health journeys. Each chapter explains the causes of poor health, the evidence behind the recommendations for good health and ends by demonstrating the health benefits of positive action. This is a core text for those studying health promotion or public health, and a supplementary text for students of healthcare and social care. The book focusses on adults' health in the UK, with examples from the four nations, and provides some contextual international information where relevant. Priorities for Health Promotion and Public Health is an ideal companion for busy practitioners who work across the wider sectors that support people's health and wellbeing. It is also a core textbook for students new to health promotion and public health."

        "summary": "This book will examine the role and the opportunity for EDI advancement as a requisite in healthcare, particularly in the context of the professional landscape as this directly affects care delivery. It considers the problems of clinicians who continue to suffer the ill effects of being othered within a medical setting. It argues that clinicians lacking the awareness and skills necessary to engage in an EDI-informed manner with members of their professional setting and patients, and benignly unaware of their privilege cannot effectively deliver care. The goal is to engage readers in a more inclusive practice."

It shows that brain emotion and motor control networks are tightly integrated via the cingulate motor cortex and other hubs, and introduces how the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord work together to form a big central pattern generator (CPG) to control human walking. The book also highlights the core of motor training for stroke patients, that is, how to build a rational mode to exert force, and introduces a brief tool for assessing cognitive function. It also shows how to assess fall risks in community-dwelling elderly people, and introduces a sequential water swallowing test, a special protocol of FEES, and the oropharyngeal electrical-vibration stimulation to improve swallow function."

It investigates how dance bodies work with the micromovements elicited by language\u2019s affective forces, and the micropolitics of the thought-sensations that arise when movement and words accompany one another within choreographic contexts. Situating itself where theory meets practice\u2014the zone where ideas arise to be tested, the book draws on embodied research in practices within the lineages of American postmodern dance and Japanese butoh, set in dialog with affect-based philosophies and somatics. Understanding that language is felt, both when uttered and when unspoken, this book speaks to the choreographic thinking that takes place when language is considered a primary element in creating the sensorium."

        "summary": "Ambient Sufism is a study of the intertwined musical lives of several ritual communities in Tunisia that invoke the healing powers of long-deceased Muslim saints through music-driven trance rituals. Richard C. Jankowsky illuminates the virtually undocumented role of women and minorities in shaping the ritual musical landscape of the region, with case studies on men\u2019s and women\u2019s Sufi orders, Jewish and black Tunisian healing musical troupes, and the popular music of hard-drinking laborers, as well as the cohorts involved in mass-mediated staged spectacles of ritual that continue to inject ritual sounds into the public sphere. He uses the term \u201cambient Sufism\u201d to illuminate these adjacent ritual practices, each serving as a musical, social, and devotional-therapeutic niche while contributing to a larger, shared ecology of practices surrounding and invoking the figures of saints. And he argues that ritual musical form\u2014that is, the large-scale structuring of ritual through musical organization\u2014has agency; that is, form is revealing and constitutive of experience and encourages particular subjectivities. Ambient Sufism promises many useful ideas for ethnomusicology, anthropology, Islamic and religious studies, and North African studies."

In quantum field theory or general relativity, mathematics and physics are inextricably interwoven. As such, the book is mathematically rigorous. The author focuses on the properties of the quantum system that can be observed and measured and interprets the resulting theory. The methods of operator theory are discussed throughout in the formulation of the theory as well as in the calculation of the consequences of the theory. The book addresses the mathematical support of the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics through the spectral theorems for (densely-defined and linear) self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces. Considerable focus is placed on the measurement process and questions the challenges of the wave function, the EPR paradox, and Bell\u2019s inequality."

The book identifies the conditions during any public health crisis that heighten the mental health needs of children and adolescents and suggests the reforms of mental health services needed to better meet the needs of children and youths during and following pandemics and other public health crises. Importance is placed not only on addressing the effects of COVID-19 but on anticipating and preparing for other public health disruptions to the lives of those who have not reached adulthood. Although mental health services in all settings are considered, special attention is given to the role of schools in providing for the mental health of children and adolescents and preparing for the mental health implications of future public health disruptions. The book will be of equal use to both students and researchers in the fields of mental health, wellbeing and education as well as teachers, educational psychologists, social workers, and practitioners working in schools and communities to address students' mental health needs. It will help readers better understand how and why COVID-19 was a negative influence on students' mental health, and unpack how best to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic."

The follow up to Liliana Corobca\u2019s critically-acclaimed novel of censorship in eastern Europe, The Censor\u2019s Notebook. \u201cCorobca tells a moving story about everyday life as a child in a broken adult world, about outrage, longing, tenderness, and anger.\u201d \u2014WDR5 (Germany) \u201cIn [Kinderland] Liliana Corobca has painstakingly examined\u2026locations and territories that resemble Lord of the Flies\u2026 and has written a novel that is complicated and harsh, but also moving and full of candor.\u201d \u2014Observator Cultural With her parents gone in search of work, twelve-year-old Cristina must act as a mother to her two younger brothers. Through her eyes, we roam the streets of a contemporary Moldovan village populated almost entirely with children and old people. Just as most of the inhabitants left their countryside and homes with the desire to earn a better income, their parents also went to the world for money, the mother to Italy, the father to Siberia, and the children were left to fend for themselves. Here the youth must learn to survive on their own; they grow up fast, imitating the gestures of the absent adults, and chasing their fading memories of normal family life. A novel that deals with a painful true reality, which has over time grown to become a phenomenon: the lives and struggles of children left home alone by parents who have gone to work abroad."

        "summary": "This is an original book, covering all the past areas of research anyone would need to know about festivals and \u2018event-based culture\u2019. It is based on academic research but written in a way relevant for cultural professionals \u2013 uniquely explaining the cultural power of festivals, and with original empirical research, the realities of organisation and management, and social and economic value. Dr Jonathan Vickery, Reader in Cultural Policy Studies and Director: Centre for Cultural and Media Policy Studies, Univeristy of Warwick. This book discusses music festivals in the context of the specific values they convey. Today, music festivals are a permanent feature of national, regional and local cultural policies, a valuable asset in the tourism industry and a significant source of income for an industry that has been adversely affected by the steady decline in physical sales of music. For the audience, on the other hand, it is an opportunity to escape from everyday life, multi-sensory contact with art, an activity that stands for \u201cfull-body participation\u201d\u2013 a cultural phenomenon that drags people out of their homes like no other. There is one common denominator linking the above-mentioned features of contemporary music festivals \u2013 namely the world of values. This is evident from the non-accidental locations, festivals spaces\u2019 design, planning and the line-ups created consciously, with great care. The organisers\u2019 \u201cmissions\u201d, logos, and other symbolic organisational artefacts communicate specific values. These values are explicitly mentioned by artists and audiences: they can be easily identified in online forums and media reports; participant behaviour, festival \u201crituals\u201d and additional festival programs are shaped on the basis of values, and cooperation is built between the festival and the local community. As the reader will quickly realize, numbers and statistics sit alongside descriptions and quotations in this book, and the organisers\u2019 statements are accompanied by the opinions of academics, but above all the festival audience is given a voice \u2013 both through quotations and their drawings. This voice is by no means uniform, as it turned out that research into values was often transformed into a pretext for spinning tales about one\u2019s life situation, one\u2019s political preferences, and one\u2019s understanding of freedom and responsibility. Memories were mixed with declarations, joy with regret, curses with dreams, prose with poetry. Thomas Pettitt was not wrong in noting that \u201cSocial history has learnt to appreciate festival as a valuable window on society and its structures\u201d. The authors have tried to open all the windows available. Students and researchers in the fields of cultural anthropology, social psychology, folklore studies, comparative religion, sociology of culture, cultural policy, cultural history, and cultural management will find this book highly interesting."

        "summary": "This book shows senior leaders how to leverage their unique personalities as an essential resource to help guide their organizations. Conventional leadership coaching approaches focus primarily on personal change, exploring the qualities that define successful leaders. But to truly play transformative and visionary roles within their organizations, C-suite and other senior leaders must accurately gauge their own strengths and weaknesses, and learn to identify and address the \"shadow side\" of their personality traits. This book offers a unique model for strategic leadership by encouraging leaders to think carefully about their personal leadership styles. The authors show readers how to use their Big Five personality profiles to identify their unique personality strengths, how to understand the personality styles of others they encounter in professional scenarios, and how to use this knowledge to steer their organizations to greater success. Becoming a Strategic Leader also provides guidelines for coaching staff, managing performance, creating an optimal work culture, and establishing best practices for planning and leadership in the workplace."

        "summary": "The contributors to Remapping Sound Studies intervene in current trends and practices in sound studies by reorienting the field toward the global South. Attending to disparate aspects of sound in Africa, South and Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Micronesia, and a Southern outpost in the global North, this volume broadens the scope of sound studies and challenges some of the field's central presuppositions. The contributors show how approaches to and uses of technology across the global South complicate narratives of technological modernity and how sound-making and listening in diverse global settings unsettle familiar binaries of sacred/secular, private/public, human/nonhuman, male/female, and nature/culture. Exploring a wide range of sonic phenomena and practices, from birdsong in the Marshall Islands to Zulu ululation, the contributors offer diverse ways to remap and decolonize modes of thinking about and listening to sound.

        "summary": "This book presents an in-depth exploration of complex metal oxides, focusing on their applications in photocatalysis and biomedical materials. It highlights the practical importance of complex metal oxides, which have gained significant attention in recent years due to their diverse range of properties. The book specifically delves into the most representative series of compounds based on stable structural types of minerals, such as perovskite, fluorite, pyrochlore, corundum, and rutile. It also emphasizes the scientific interest in the pyrochlore mineral structure, which has been shown to exhibit photocatalytic activity. Recent studies have revealed that some compounds with the pyrochlore structure can act as promising candidates for photocatalysis. Additionally, the book highlights the use of photocatalysis in producing biomedical materials based on natural polymers. These materials possess a unique combination of components assembled in a specific structure, which makes them highly attractive for regenerative medicine associated with cell/tissue regeneration stimulation. Overall, this book offers a comprehensive analysis of the potential of complex metal oxides, particularly those with the pyrochlore structure, and is particularly useful for those researchers working in the fields of green chemistry and biomedical materials science."

        "summary": "In 1832, just before his untimely death, twenty year old French mathematical genius, Everiste Galois spent the whole night rewriting the new mathematics he had discovered. It gave an amazing answer to a mathematical problem from antiquity. He could not know it then, but his new mathematics also enabled our modern world through its application to quantum mechanics and coding theory. His new mathematics wasn't easy and Galois' overly brief writing style had rendered a previous draft of his ideas incomprehensible to the top mathematicians of the day. However, he did know that he might not have much time to give this new mathematics to the world. He was right - he was mortally wounded in a duel the next day. It has since been useful to put Galois theory within a framework of more abstract algebraic concepts, but this has made his work accessible only to those with advanced mathematics. This book follows Galois' original approach but avoids his overly brief style. Instead, unlike other books, it makes Galois' amazing mathematical ideas accessible to those with just university entrance level mathematics. Quadratic equations were solved with the help of square roots in ancient times. Equations with an x3 and those with an x4 term were solved 500 years ago with the help of cube roots and fourth roots, though with increasingly difficult formulas. Galois showed that a formula with square roots, cube roots and fourth and fifth roots, cannot be obtained for the quintic - an equation with an x5 term. It is not just that any potential formula would be so long and difficult that it has not yet been discovered, it is absolutely impossible. The proof of this impossibility is long and occupies this whole book, but readers are rewarded by getting to understand something that at first sight may seem impossible, a proof of impossibility. Readers will also be rewarded by getting to fully understand the series of startlingly clever mathematical manipulations of a genius."

        "summary": "Polarity sensitivity is a ubiquitous phenomenon involving expressions such as anybody, nobody, ever, never, somebody and their counterparts in other languages. These expressions belong to different classes such as negative and positive polarity, negative concord, and negative indefinites. In this book, Ahmad Alqassas proposes a unified approach to the study of this phenomenon that relies on examining the interaction between the various types of polarity sensitivity, with a particular focus on Arabic. Alqassas shows that treating this interaction is fundamental for scrutinizing their licensing conditions. Alqassas draws on data from Standard Arabic and the major regional dialects represented by Jordanian, Egyptian, Moroccan, and Qatari. Through the (micro)comparative approach, Alqassas explains the distributional contrasts with a minimal set of universal syntactic operations such as Merge, Move, and Agree. He also considers a fine-grained inventory of negative formal features for polarity items and their licensors. These simple features paint a complex landscape of polarity and lead to important conclusions about syntactic computation. By engaging with the rich but under-studied landscape of Arabic polarity sensitivity, this book provides a new perspective on the syntax-semantic interface and develops a unified syntactic analysis for polarity sensitivity. These contributions have important implications for the study of Arabic and for syntactic theory more generally."

        "summary": "Grammaticalization has often been described as a gradual phenomenon. While many studies have discussed the quantitative aspects of grammaticalization, there has been little to no work that has tried to propose a way of measuring degrees of grammaticalization. This book addresses this gap by proposing a corpus-based approach to the measurement of grammaticalization, using binary logistic regression modelling. Such an approach has theoretical benefits as it can provide empirical evidence for the gradience and gradualness of grammaticalization. It can help substantiate observations that have been done on the basis of case studies so far, such as the hypothesized unidirectionality of grammaticalization. In addition, as the methods proposed in this book rely on corpus-based data only, it offers a way of comparing grammaticalization across multiple languages, which is currently a challenging endeavour. What this book hopes to achieve is to start a discussion on the measurement of grammaticalization. To draw a parallel, the field of morphological productivity has greatly benefited from the discussions (and disputes) regarding how its object of study should be measured, and I believe that so will the field of grammaticalization."

        "summary": "This ground-breaking book sets out a fresh vision for a future medical education by providing a radical reconceptualization of the purposes of medical humanities through a lens of critical health psychology and liberatory pedagogy. The medical humanities are conceived as translational media through which reductive, instrumental biomedicine can be raised in quality, intensity, and complexity by embracing ethical, aesthetic, and political values. This translation occurs through innovative use of metaphor. A note of caution is offered - that the medical humanities too can be instrumental and reductive if not framed well. Drawing on major theorists such as Foucault and Ranci\u00e8re and bringing together insights from diverse but inter-related fields, Bleakley focuses on the \"ills\" of contemporary biomedicine and medical education, and the need for reconceptualization, which- it is argued- the translational medical humanities have the potential to accomplish. Current instrumental approaches to medical humanities, embracing communication skills training and narrative-based medicine, have failed to address the chronic symptoms suffered by medicine. These include: resort to closed, functional systems thinking rather than embracing dynamic, complex, open, and adaptive systems thinking; lack of democratic habits in medical culture, compromising patient safety and care; the production of insensibility rather than deepening of sensibility in medical education; a lack of attention to ethics, aesthetics, and politics where the instrumental is privileged; and a lack of critical reflexivity in revisioning habitual practices. Through persuasive argument, Bleakley sets out a more radical manifesto for the role the arts and humanities might play in medical/healthcare education and offers a new approach based on curriculum process rather than syllabus content, to recuperate aesthetic sensibilities, discernment, and affect in medicine. The book will appeal to medical and healthcare educators, medical and health humanities scholars, engaged clinicians, social scientists drawing on critical theory, and arts and humanities practitioners engaging with medical and healthcare themes."

It engages a wide range of recent scholarship and emerging research covering many crucial topics in clinical ethics. While there has been increasing attention to the role of bioethics in medicine, the gap between theory and practice still exists, and it continues to impede the dialogue between health care professionals from one side and bioethicists and philosophers of medicine from the other side. This book builds bridges and open channels of connection between different parties in these conversations. It does so from a physician\u2019s practical perspective, engaging recent scholarship and emerging research, to shed light on pivotal ethical dilemmas in contemporary clinical practice."

        "summary": "This volume stresses the importance of a multidisciplinary perspective in deepening knowledge of the interface between semantics and pragmatics. It thoroughly investigates concepts belonging to Neo-Gricean and post-Gricean theories. Theoretical research in pragmatics has challenged the idea of a close relation between literal meaning and the explicitly conveyed proposition, claiming that situational context is responsible for an ongoing process of adjusting and revising what a speaker says. Similarly, recent discoveries from the clinical side have highlighted the importance of extra-linguistic sources and the cognitive context in the syntactic and semantic competence of people with language disorders. The productive comparison between reflections from theoretical pragmatics and the most recent developments in cognitive sciences provides an authentic way of addressing traditional philosophical issues, moving them to a new fertile ground. The research herein is gathered across disciplines to provide theoretical and clinical contributions and collaborations, making this book broadly appropriate to students, researchers and professionals in the fields."

        "summary": "This complex account by a German governess examines households, families, and slavery in Brazil, and bears witness to how \"the world the slaveholders made\" would soon collapse. Ina von Binzer's letters, published in German in 1887 and translated into English for this book, offer a rare view of three very different elite family households during the twilight years of Brazil's Second Empire. Her woman's gaze contrasts markedly with other contributions to the contemporary travel literature on Brazil that were nearly entirely written by men. Although von Binzer covers a multitude of topics--ranging from the management of households and plantations, the behavior of slaves and slaveowners, and the agricultural production of coffee and sugar to examinations of family relations, childrearing, culinary repertoires, and life on the street--the common theme running through her letters is the dawning perception that the world the slaveholders made could not long endure. She delves into the inevitable arrival of abolition as a national issue and a nascent movement--a destiny that her employers can no longer ignore. In recounting her conversations with them, she offers her own insights into their opinions and behaviors that make for a fascinating insider's view of a world about to disappear. Von Binzer's letters are prefaced by a valuable historical introduction that surveys the contexts of slavery's slow demise after 1850 and offers new biographical research on von Binzer and the prominent families who employed her. A map of her travels together with dozens of photographs contemporary with her residence in Brazil provide visual documentation complementary to her letters."

        "summary": "This book examines imperial and nationalist discourses surrounding three contemporaneous and unsuccessful mid-nineteenth-century colonial uprisings against the British Empire: the Sepoy Rebellion (1857) in India, the Morant Bay Rebellion (1865) in Jamaica, and the Fenian Rebellion (1867) in Ireland. In reading these three mid-century rebellions as flashpoints for the varying yet parallel attempts by imperialist colonialists, nationalists, and socialists to transform the oppressed colonized worker (the subjected laborer) into one whose identity is created and limited by labor (a laboring subject), this book also tracks varying modes of resistance to those attempts in all three colonies. In drawing from a range of historical, literary, and visual sources outside the borders of the Anglophone literary canon, this book contends that these texts not only serve as points of engagements with the rebellions but also constitute an archive of oppression and resistance."

        "summary": "Skimpy Coverage explores Sports Illustrated's treatment of female athletes since the iconic magazine's founding in 1954. The first book-length study of its kind, this accessible account charts the ways in which Sports Illustrated--arguably the leading sports publication in postwar America--engaged with the social and cultural changes affecting women's athletics and the conversations about gender and identity they spawned. Bonnie Hagerman examines the emergence of the magazine's archetypal female athlete--good-looking, straight, and white--and argues that such qualities were the same ones the magazine prized in the women who appeared in its wildly successful Swimsuit Issue. As Hagerman shows, the female athlete and the swimsuit model, at least for the magazine, were essentially one and the same. Despite this conflation, and the challenges it poses, Hagerman also tracks the distance that sportswomen--including Wilma Rudolph, Billie Jean King, Serena Williams, and Megan Rapinoe--have traveled both within Sports Illustrated's pages and without. Blending sports with gender history, Skimpy Coverage profiles numerous sportswomen who have used athletics and the platform sport offers to push for empowerment, freedom, equality, and acceptance in ways that have complemented and inspired broader feminist agendas."

Art objects from the region were distributed to museums and private collections around the world. But in the 21st century, power relations are shifting, a new awareness is growing, and new questions are emerging about the representation and ownership of Southeast Asian cultural material located in the West. This book is a timely consideration of object restitution and related issues across Southeast Asia, bringing together different viewpoints including from museum professionals and scholars in Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia - as well as Europe, North America and Australia. The objects themselves are at the centre of most narratives - from Khmer art to the Mandalay regalia (repatriated in 1964), Ban Chiang archaeological material and the paintings of Raden Saleh. Legal, cultural, political and diplomatic issues involved in the restitution process are considered in many of the chapters; others look at the ways object restitution is integral to evolving narratives of national identity.\"--Publisher's description"

Humanity in the twenty-first century is facing what might be described as its ultimate environmental catastrophe: the destruction of the climate that has nurtured human civilization and with it the basis of life on earth as we know it. All ecosystems on the planet are now in decline. Enormous rifts have been driven through the delicate fabric of the biosphere. The economy and the earth are headed for a fateful collision--if we don't alter course. Environmental sociologists John Bellamy Foster, Brett Clark, and Richard York argue that the source of our ecological crisis lies in the paradox of wealth in capitalist society, which expands individual riches at the expense of public wealth, including the wealth of nature. In the process, a huge ecological rift is driven between human beings and nature, undermining the conditions of sustainable existence."

In COVID-19: A History the physician and medical historian Jacalyn Duffin presents a global history of the virus, with a focus on Canada. Duffin describes the frightening appearance of the virus and its identification by scientists in China; subsequent outbreaks on cruise ships; the relentless spread to Europe, the Americas, Africa, and elsewhere; and the immediate attempts to confront it. COVID-19: A History next explores the scientific history of infections generally, and the discovery of coronaviruses in particular. Taking a broad approach, the book explains the advent of tests, treatments, and vaccines, as well as the practical politics behind interventions, including quarantines, barrier technologies, lockdowns, and social and financial supports, In concluding chapters Duffin analyzes the outcome of successive waves of COVID-19 infection around the world: the toll of human suffering, the successes and failures of control measures, vaccine rollouts, and grassroots opposition to governments' attempts to limit the spread and mitigate social and economic damages. Closing with the fraught search for the origins of COVID-19, Duffin considers the implications of an \"infodemic\" and provides an optimistic outlook for the future."

        "summary": "For over 80 years, the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) has been a leader in the promotion of ethical practice within the field of engineering. One of the Society's greatest contributions is the formation and adoption of the NSPE Code of Ethics. But the code, with its six \"Fundamental Canons,\" is only truly instructive if engineers can bridge the gap between principles and action. Here there is no substitute for personal reflection on the ethical and philosophical issues that underlie the code. If done well, such reflection provides an indispensable basis for moral problem solving. Beyond the Code: A Philosophical Guide to Engineering Ethics is designed to complement the NSPE Code of Ethics by helping readers \"go beyond\" in their understanding of the philosophical issues bound up in the code. Each chapter addresses one of the Fundamental Canons of the NSPE code, and provides a philosophical analysis of the various parts of each canon by employing contemporary and classical texts. This unique approach to engineering ethics guides students and professionals in their readings of the appended selections to refine their understanding of the code in order to apply it to the practical challenges of today's engineers. Key Features: Is the first introduction to engineering ethics that helps students understand and apply the NSPE Code of Ethics to engineering practice Includes a Preface from Arthur E. Schwartz, NSPE Deputy Executive Director and General Counsel, and NAFE Executive Director As a hybrid text, includes primary philosophical texts with extensive introductions and guided reading questions from the book's three authors Offers case studies from the NSPE Board of Ethical Review, allowing students to see a direct connection between the issues discussed in the text and real-world engineering practice Includes the following pedagogical aids: \"Key Terms and Concepts\" for each chapter \"Preparing to Read\" sections before each primary source reading \"Guided Reading Questions\" after each primary source reading \"Going Beyond--Our Questions for a Deep Dive\" after each case study."

It is the vision of a world with buildings that grow, self-heal and create virtuous cycles where waste from one process feeds another. A vision where the spaces that we inhabit are attuned to both the human occupants and non-human microbial ecologies. This is the first book to ground the concept of biotechnology in the built environment in tangible, large-scale prototypes. With rich visuals, it presents materials and processes that exploit the many possibilities of shaping the built environment with micro-organisms. At the same time, scientific and technical challenges are discussed, pointing to the need for a shift in thinking and culture to ensure progress. First comprehensive publication on the state of research Demonstrates the use of renewable materials in design Illustrative, scientific documentation for design professions and researchers"

        "summary": "A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist shows how conservatives have pushed for a revolution in public education--one that threatens the existence of the traditional public school America has relied on public schools for 150 years, but the system is increasingly under attack. With declining enrollment and diminished trust in public education, policies that steer tax dollars into private schools have grown rapidly. To understand how we got here, The Death of Public School argues, we must look back at the turbulent history of school choice. Cara Fitzpatrick uncovers the long journey of school choice, a story full of fascinating people and strange political alliances. She shows how school choice evolved from a segregationist tool in the South in the 1950s, to a policy embraced by advocates for educational equity in the North, to a conservative strategy for securing government funds for private schools in the twenty-first century. As a result, education is poised to become a private commodity rather than a universal good. The Death of Public School presents the compelling history of the fiercest battle in the history of American education--one that already has changed the future of public schooling."

        "summary": "This book deals with the important topic of policies for sustainable agriculture, since food insecurity is a growing concern for policy makers and will affect the quality of life and well-being of generations to come. The authors provide a theoretical background to the concept of sustainable agriculture including its recent developments; monitor the current state of sustainability in agriculture in different regions of the world; and evaluate current agricultural policies to propose new solutions. They show practical ways of sustainability measurement that could be applied to different regions. The book takes into account sustainability indicators based on economic, social and environmental aspects and discusses the trade-offs between these three dimensions. It also answers the question of whether current agricultural policies contribute to balancing between the goals of agriculture---that of not just providing food but of contributing to the greater good---and how policies differ and have evolved across the world. Finally, it puts together the best practices of sustainability for the use of policymakers. The book pays particular attention to least developed countries where hunger and malnutrition are high, but where productivity should not come at the expense of environmental and social goals. This book is of use to a wide readership of policy makers, professionals and academics in the social and environmental sciences interested in the improvement of human life through sustainable agricultural policy implementation."

Inspired by \"As We See It,\" an exhibition of these artists' work cocurated by Fricke in 2015, the book showcases the extraordinary achievements of these groundbreaking photographers. As We See It presents dialogues in which the artists share their unique perspectives about the history and current state of photography. Each chapter includes an overview of the photographer's career as well as examples of the artist's work. For added context, Fricke includes an introduction, a preface that explores the original exhibition of the same name, and an essay that challenges the ghost of Edward S. Curtis, whose work serves as a counterpoint to the photography of contemporary Native Americans. The text is designed to be read as a whole or in sections for anyone teaching Native American photography. As We See It is an invaluable addition to the library of anyone interested in Native American photography and will be the key source for teachers, researchers, and lovers of photography for years to come."

        "summary": "Medical science in antebellum America was organized around a paradox: it presumed African Americans to be less than human yet still human enough to be viable as experimental subjects, as cadavers, and for use in the training of medical students. By taking a hard look at the racial ideas of both northern and southern medical schools, Christopher D. E. Willoughby reveals that racist ideas were not external to the medical profession but fundamental to medical knowledge. In this history of racial thinking and slavery in American medical schools, the founders and early faculty of these schools emerge as singularly influential proponents of white supremacist racial science. They pushed an understanding of race influenced by the theory of polygenesis--that each race was created separately and as different species--which they supported by training students to collect and measure human skulls from around the world. Medical students came to see themselves as masters of Black people's bodies through stealing Black people's corpses, experimenting on enslaved people, and practicing distinctive therapeutics on Black patients. In documenting these practices Masters of Health charts the rise of racist theories in U.S. medical schools, throwing new light on the extensive legacies of slavery in modern medicine."

        "summary": "\"At the center of the 'war on women' lies the fact that women in the contemporary United States are facing increased surveillance of their reproductive health. In recent years states have passed a record number of laws restricting abortion and reproductive rights. Physicians continue to sterilize some women against their will, especially those in prison; in other cases, women seeking medical interventions to prevent pregnancies encounter resistance from the medical community. While these trends seem to undermine women's decision-making authority, experts and state actors often defend such policies and actions as actually promoting women's autonomy. In Governed through Choice, Jennifer M. Denbow analyzes recent reproductive measures, such as 'informed consent' to abortion laws and the regulation of sterilization, in order to expose how the notion of autonomy allows for such a striking contradiction in how reproductive policies affect women. Yet, Denbow also offers an understanding of autonomy as critique and transformation of oppressive norms. Denbow shows how developments in reproductive technology, which would seem to increase women's options and autonomy, provide increased opportunities for state management of women's bodies. However, she also argues that reproductive technologies can disrupt oppressive norms about reproduction and gender and ultimately enable social transformation. A critically important analysis, Governed through Choice is a trailblazing look at how the law regulates women's bodies as reproductive sites and what can be done about it\"--Unedited summary from paperback book cover."

The book refuses the simplicity of Pierre Bourdieu's famous dictum that dislike is (only) snobbery. Instead, Jonathan Gray pushes onward to uncover other explanations for what it ultimately means to dislike specific artifacts of television, film, and other media, and why this dislike matters.As we watch and listen through gritted teeth, Dislike-Minded listens to what is being said, and presents a bold case for a new line of audience research within communication, media, and cultural studies."

Howard has produced a comprehensive investigation into the remarkable impact of chess across a wide range of times and places up to the present day, touching on cultural history, the nature of competitiveness, artificial intelligence, psychology, art, literature, gender issues, education, and much more in an attempt to comprehensively address the question of what makes the game so unique. These essays provide insightful and playful reflections on the (ab)uses of the history of the game to the birth of the modern game as a competitive sport and the way it is run by FIDE. Howard also questions several of the long-held assumptions about its widely acclaimed benefits and highlights the many surprising contemporary applications of chess to artificial intelligence, prison reform, social inequality, and more and makes sharp observations on what chess reveals about current attitudes to gender, technology, sports, entertainment and the nature of play.\" --"

This use of critical thinking will minimize the likelihood of mistakes that can result in the wasting of finite resources and the possible loss of life. Included in this book are examples, both successful and unsuccessful, for each of the functions on which industrial engineers focus. These examples include the critical questions that were asked that resulted in success and those questions that were not asked that resulted in failure. Integration of Methods Improvement and Measurement into Industrial Engineering Functions is applicable to students, new graduates, and practitioners in the areas of industrial engineering, human factors, materials processing, quality control, asset management, production control, and supply chain management, as well as those concerned with safety issues."

Though the book's focus is ostensibly the man himself, the text unfolds as a comprehensive look at the Soviet, post-Soviet, and American cultures that shaped him and which he shaped. Dovlatov and Surroundings constantly, but effortlessly shifts its focus from the intimate to the sweeping, as Genis's reflections on his friendship with Dovlatov organically give way to recollections about diaspora life, which transition smoothly into analyses of language, culture, politics, and literature. Characterized by Genis as an obituary, this book makes plain the significance of Dovlatov to Russian literature and the nuances of the Soviet cultural heritage."

In reading these three mid-century rebellions as flashpoints for the varying yet parallel attempts by imperialist colonialists, nationalists, and socialists to transform the oppressed colonized worker (the subjected laborer) into one whose identity is created and limited by labor (a laboring subject), this book also tracks varying modes of resistance to those attempts in all three colonies. In drawing from a range of historical, literary, and visual sources outside the borders of the Anglophone literary canon, this book contends that these texts not only serve as points of engagements with the rebellions but also constitute an archive of oppression and resistance."

That's a mistake, says Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others). In this provocative and persuasive new book, he asserts that the secret to high performance and satisfaction-at work, at school, and at home\u2014is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does\u2014and how that affects every aspect of life. He examines the three elements of true motivation\u2014autonomy, mastery, and purpose-and offers smart and surprising techniques for putting these into action in a unique book that will change how we think and transform how we live."

        "summary": "The US dollar is the world's indispensable currency. The dollar's preeminent status gives the United States enormous coercive powers which it flexes in the form of financial sanctions to punish its adversaries. Over the last twenty years, Washington has relied on financial sanctions with greater and greater frequency. Bucking the Buck argues that the more the United States wields the dollar as a weapon of foreign policy, the more its adversaries will move their international economic activities into other currencies to avoid Washington's coercive reach. Through a combination of case studies and statistical analysis, the book establishes a relationship between US financial sanctions and the rise of \"anti-dollar\" policies, which are designed to reduce an economy's reliance on the US currency. Though some anti-dollar policies fail to achieve this goal, McDowell's analysis indicates that in many cases they are successful. Patterns of \"de-dollarization\" following sanctions are clear. In some cases, the anticipation of future sanctions may provoke similar policy measures. Though McDowell does not conclude that sanctions threaten the dollar's status as the world's key currency, the potential consequences of sanctions overuse remain important. Most notably, the use of sanctions may, over time, weaken their effectiveness as US adversaries develop systems and methods to minimize costs associated with such measures. If the United States wishes to preserve the potency of financial sanctions and protect the dollar's dominant position in the world economy, Bucking the Buck argues that Washington's approach to sanctions use should become more discerning."

        "summary": "Ideologically opposed, technologically cooperative\u2014an original account of US and USSR industrialization between the world wars. Between 1927 and 1945, a tide of hyperindustrialization washed over the United States and the Soviet Union. While the two countries remained ideologically opposed, the factories that amassed in Stalingrad, Moscow, Detroit, Buffalo, and Cleveland were strikingly similar, as were the new forms of modern work and urban and infrastructural development that supported this industrialization. Drawing on previously unknown archival materials and photographs, the essays in Detroit-Moscow-Detroit document a stunning two-way transfer of technical knowledge between the United States and the USSR that greatly influenced the built environment in both countries, upgrading each to major industrial power by the start of the Second World War. The innovative research presented here explores spatial development, manufacturing, mass production, and organizational planning across geopolitical lines to demonstrate that capitalist and communist built environments in the twentieth century were not diametrically opposed and were, on certain sites, coproduced in a period of intense technical exchange between the two world wars. A fresh account of the effects of industrialization and globalization on US and Soviet cultures, architecture, and urban history, Detroit-Moscow-Detroit will find wide readership among architects, urban designers, and scholars of architectural, urban, and twentieth-century history.

        "summary": "Women are contributing to disciplines once the sole domain of men. Field biology has been no different. The history of women field biologists, embedded in a history largely made and recorded by men, has never been written. Compilations of biographies have been assembled, but the narrative--their story--has never been told. In part, this is because many expressed their passion for nature as writers, artists, collectors, and educators during eras when women were excluded from the male-centric world of natural history and science. The history of women field biologists is intertwined with men's changing views of female intellect and with increasing educational opportunities available to women. Given the preponderance of today's professional female ecologists, animal behaviorists, systematists, conservation biologists, wildlife biologists, restoration ecologists, and natural historians, it is time to tell this story--the challenges and hardships they faced and still face, and the prominent role they have played and increasingly play in understanding our natural world. For a broader perspective, we profile selected European women field biologists, but our primary focus is the journey of women field biologists in North America. Each woman highlighted here followed a unique path. For some, personal wealth facilitated their work; some worked alongside their husbands. Many served as invisible assistants to men, receiving little or no recognition. Others were mavericks who carried out pioneering studies, and whose published works are still read and valued today. All served as inspiration and proved to the women who would follow that women are as capable as men at studying nature in nature. Their legacy lives on today. The 75 female field biologists interviewed for this book are further testament that women have the intellect, stamina, and passion for fieldwork."

        "summary": "This book provides a critical analysis of the experiences of people with disabilities in Latin America. It covers a wide range of topics related to intellectual and psychosocial disabilities. Written by Latin American researchers and adopting an interdisciplinary perspective, it provides an original sociocultural contribution to bioethics and disability studies literature. It presents an in-depth overview of philosophical, ethical, legal, political and social issues. At the same time, it offers a contribution to the global scientific community inasmuch it discusses theoretical references from South America in connection with those from Europe and the United States. The basic questions dealt with range from criteria for human flourishing to questions of philosophy of mind, and neuroethics through phenomenological and aesthetic approaches to intellectual and psychosocial disabilities. The legal and political investigations explore the rights of those affected and the processes of their self-organization. The authors address the dynamics of medicalization and demedicalization, the practices of psychiatric institutionalization and the treatment of children with antipsychotics. This book appeals to psychologists, social scientists, bioethicists, healthcare personnel, philosophers, and lawyers working with cases related to people with disabilities."

        "summary": "A lavishly illustrated overview of contemporary Korean art that offers new insight into the country's tumultuous modern history and its multifaceted and vibrant art scene Focusing on the work of 33 artists, this volume examines the ways contemporary Korean art reflects the dynamic changes in the country following the 1980 Gwangju Uprising and 1988 Seoul Olympics, when a newly democratic South Korea opened up to the rest of the world and quickly became a key player, both economically and culturally, on the global stage. Among the works featured are complex installations by Do Ho Suh and siren eun young jung; sculptures made from disparate materials by Yeesookyung; embroideries that engage with fraught political issues via covert transactions with embroiderers in North Korea by Kyungah Ham; and paintings of contemporary pop figures made using traditional East Asian techniques by Konghyun Son. Essays by a diverse group of scholars position the works in their historical and sociopolitical contexts within the accelerated timeline--and resulting compression of past, present, and future--of what has been called Korea's long twenty-first century. With artist biographies, an illustrated chronology, and a selected bibliography, this study is the first English-language presentation of this material and is a significant contribution to the interpretation and understanding of contemporary Korean art and culture.

Desperate to work again in physically shared spaces, we are also now questioning whether offices ? and the demanding, alienating rhythms they impose on us ? are needed at all.0Offices themselves labour under intolerable forces too: twenty-first-century building regulations suggest redesigning them every seven-to-ten years, managerial strategies typically shift every five years, and employees churn every two. As a result, offices are torn down, stripped out, rethought and renewed with alarming frequency. 0With the future of our workspaces so uncertain, Back to the Office works overtime inside the revolutionary offices of the twentieth century, and asks what endured from their architecture, their materials, and the ideologies of work they embodied.0Using before-and-after photography, archival documents, contemporary interviews and critical essays, this book engages corporations, architects, workers, building managers, regulators and others ? all in search of the lessons we need to learn from a very recent time when there was an unambivalent enthusiasm for office life."

        "summary": "The long-anticipated monograph on OMA New York by Shohei Shigematsu and Jason Long is sure to be the design and architecture book of the season. Presenting more than 20 radical architectural projects from a new generation of the firm, this mammoth volume is the first compendium by OMA, since Content and Rem Koolhaas\u2019s S, M, L, XL. Well into its fourth decade, the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), founded by Rem Koolhaas in 1975, remains one of the most influential and successful practices of its kind. OMA describes itself as \u201ca firm operating within the traditional boundaries of architecture and urbanism that applies architectural thinking to domains beyond.\u201d OMA New York, has grown from an American outpost to a full-fledged operation with its own attitudes, contributing to the evolution of the globally acclaimed office. Through a diversity of projects, the firm has transformed our understanding of the city and our evolving relationship with art, fashion, food, sustainability, and other quintessentially twenty-first-century preoccupations. The works presented here elaborate on OMA\u2019s philosophy even as they expand its portfolio geographically. Featured projects (led by partners Shohei Shigematsu and Jason Long) include residential skyscrapers in New York, Miami, and San Francisco, mixed-use developments in cities from Tokyo to Houston, and projects like 11th Street Bridge Park in the public realm, alongside more intimate spaces such as the studio for renowned Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang. Permanent structures, such as Milstein Hall at Cornell University, the new galleries of Quebec\u2019s Mus\u00e9e National des Beaux-Arts, a cultural forum and neighborhood for Faena in Miami, and the expansion of museums such as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and the New Museum in Manhattan, contrast vividly with temporary interventions such as the Manus x Machina exhibition at the Met Costume Institute and the sculptural installation of soaring concrete columns for An Occupation of Loss. In between projects are dialogues with leading policy makers, museum directors, artists, fashion designers, musicians, chefs, and curators\u2014Christopher Hawthorne, Lisa Phillips and Massimiliano Gioni, Taryn Simon, Iris van Herpen, Virgil Abloh, David Byrne, Alice Waters, and Cecilia Alemani\u2014who provide insight onto areas of the firm\u2019s interests and preoccupations beyond the realm of architecture."

        "summary": "Following his memoir Cured, a fascinating deep dive into the dark Romanticism of Goth music, a misunderstood genre and culture by co-founder of The Cure, Lol Tolhurst GOTHIC is an entertaining and engaging historical memoir of the genre of Goth music and culture, exploring creative giants like The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, Joy Division, and many more great bands that offered a place of refuge for the misfits of the 80s and ever since. Written by Lol Tolhurst, co-founder of The Cure, this book offers a fascinating deep dive into the movers and shakers of goth with stories and anecdotes from Tolhurst's personal memories as well as the musicians, magicians, and artists, who made it all happen--the people, places, and events that made goth an inevitable and enduring movement. Starting with the Origins of Goth, Tolhurst explores early art and literature that inspired the genre and looks into the work of T.S Eliot, Edgar Allan Poe, Sylvia Plath , Albert Camus and more. He also outlines the path of Gothic Forebears and shows how many musicians played in punk bands before transitioning into goth endeavors. Next, he introduces readers to the \"Architects of Darkness \"--Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy division and The Cure--the godfathers of goth who established the genre's roots. Following these early bands, Tolhurst discusses a group he calls the \" Spiritual Alchemists \", consisting of bands like Depeche Mode, Cocteau Twins and more, who helped the darkness expand into the culture . He also tracks the expansion of the genre overseas, from England to New York, Los Angeles, and beyond. Gothic fashion was an important part of the movement as well, and Tolhurst discusses the clothing that accompanied and complemented the music. Finally, Tolhurst examines the legacy of goth music, and shows how its influence can still be seen to this day across music, film, TV, visual arts, social media, and so much more finally concluding \"Why Goth matters!\""

        "summary": "Library of America presents the definitive edition of an essential figure in Black and American theater, spanning from the 1960s to the 2010s and including several works published for the first time Adrienne Kennedy has been a force on the American stage since the premiere of her groundbreaking, Obie Award\u2013winning Funnyhouse of a Negro in 1964. Politically engaged, formally daring, and making provocative use of material from contemporary history and popular culture, Kennedy\u2019s haunting stage works dramatize and project interior realities that are often marked by disappointment and trauma, madness and terror. Her understanding of the inner lives of African American women expresses a powerfully insightful feminism that has come to influence generations of playwrights and writers. Now, the Library of America presents, for the first time, a collected edition of Kennedy\u2019s extraordinary and wide-ranging writings, spanning six decades and including ten unpublished works. Here are the early surrealistic one-acts A Lesson in Dead Language and A Rat\u2019s Mass; works like A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White and Film Festival: The Day Jean Seberg Died that reveal Kennedy\u2019s longstanding fascination with Hollywood and film culture; and Ohio State Murders, one of several plays featuring her protagonist Suzanne Alexander and the first of her plays to be staged\u2014belatedly, in 2022\u2014on Broadway. Sleep Deprivation Chamber is a searing indictment of racially motivated police violence based on real-life incidents involving her son, who co-wrote the play. Also included here are Kennedy\u2019s adaptations of works by Euripides, Flaubert, and John Lennon, all brilliantly reimagined. Outside of playwriting Kennedy has made her mark as a fiction writer and memoirist, providing a rich portrait of her life and experience especially in her book People Who Led to My Plays but also in works from her later life such as the essay \u201cAlmost Eighty.\u201d Taken together, the work gathered in Collected Plays & Other Writings is a celebration of Kennedy\u2019s indispensable achievement on the stage and on the page alike."

        "summary": "The discriminatory logic at the heart of multilateralism Member selection is one of the defining elements of social organization, imposing categories on who we are and what we do. Discriminatory Clubs shows how international organizations are like social clubs, ones in which institutional rules and informal practices enable states to favor friends while excluding rivals. Where race or socioeconomic status may be a basis for discrimination by social clubs, geopolitical alignment determines who gets into the room to make the rules of global governance. Christina Davis brings together a wealth of data on membership provisions for more than three hundred organizations to reveal the prevalence of club-style selection on the world stage. States join organizations to deepen their association with a particular group of states\u2014most often their allies\u2014and for the gains from policy coordination. Even organizations that claim to be universal, to target narrow issues, or to cover geographic regions use club-style admission criteria. Davis demonstrates that when it comes to the most important decision of cooperation\u2014who belongs to the club and who doesn\u2019t\u2014geopolitical alignment can matter more than the merits or policies of potential members. With illuminating case studies ranging from nineteenth-century Japan to contemporary Palestine and Taiwan, Discriminatory Clubs sheds light on how, for global and regional organizations such as the WTO and the EU, alliance ties and shared foreign-policy positions form the basis of cooperation."

        "summary": "As one of the smallest and most densely populated countries in the world, the State of Israel faces serious land policy challenges and has a national identity laced with enormous internal contradictions. In Land Law and Policy in Israel, Haim Sandberg contends that if you really want to know the identity of a state, learn its land law and land policies. Sandberg argues that Israel's identity can best be understood by deciphering the code that lies in the Hebrew secret of Israeli dry land law. According to Sandberg, by examining the complex facets of property law and land policy, one finds a unique prism for comprehending Israel's most pronounced identity problems. Land Law and Policy in Israel explores how Israel's modern land system is the product of legislation from the Ottoman period and the British Mandate as well as the seventy-plus years of the State of Israel. The regulation of property and the determination of land usage have been the consequences of explicit choices made in the context of competing and evolving concepts of national identity. Land Law and Policy in Israel will prove to be a must-read not only for anyone interested in Israel but also for anyone who wants to understand the importance of land law in a nation's life."

        "summary": "Interdisciplinary essays on Manuela Infante's award-winning play explore the relationship between critical plant studies and performance art in the Anthropocene Since its first staging in 2016, Estado Vegetal, Manuela Infante's riveting piece of experimental performance art, has expanded philosophical thinking into a fully-fledged artistic inquiry into nonanthropocentric being. Through Infante's polyvocal monologue, acted with impetus by Marcela Salinas, plants are charged with an agency capable of uprooting culturally grounded conceptions of the world in the face of incommensurable trauma and loss. This first book dedicated to Infante's plant-focused performance features eight essays by scholars, poets, and artists whose practices draw from research fields as disparate as new materialism, anthropogenic feminism, queer studies, and speculative realism. Including an interview with Infante, the full playscript, and stills from the performance, Estado Vegetal: Performance and Plant-Thinking reveals the roles that plants in art can play in productively reconfiguring human-nonhuman relations within current anthropogenic perspectives. Infante's performance is a perfect case study and reference point for anyone interested in exploring the complexities of plant-thinking through alternative and experimental avenues. Furthermore, this book is at once a critical plant studies primer and an artistic problematization of the philosophical questions that have been central to the latest multidisciplinary discussions on plant-being.

This volume brings together the findings from a five-year research project that seeks to reimagine the relationship between conservation knowledge and the humanistic study of the material world. The project, \"Cultures of Conservation,\" was supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and included events, seminars, and an artist-in-residence. The effort to conserve things amid change is part of the human struggle with the nature of matter. For as long as people have made things and kept things, they have also cared for and repaired them. Today, conservators use a variety of tools and categories developed over the last one hundred and fifty years to do this work, but in the coming decades, new kinds of materials and a new scale of change will pose unprecedented challenges. Looking ahead to this moment from the perspectives of history, philosophy, materials science, and anthropology, this volume explores new possibilities for both conservation and the humanities in the rethinking of active matter."

The handbook is premised on the fact that an effective proposal doesn't merely describe a book project-it makes an active case that the manuscript should exist in published form because it has the potential to reach and appeal to actual readers. The Book Proposal Book works though the implications of this premise, showing authors how a focus on audience and usability must inform every element of their pitch. Readers of this handbook will learn how to both write a complete book proposal and confidently navigate the scholarly publishing process from pitch to contract to publication. Moreover, they will gain invaluable insight into their own research and the message they want to share with the world\"--"

        "summary": "A New York Times Bestseller Taking the story of white supremacy in America back to 1493, and examining contemporary communities in Mississippi, Minnesota, and Oklahoma for models of racial repair, The Hidden Roots of White Supremacy is \u201cfull of urgency and insight\u201d (The New York Times) as it helps chart a new course toward a genuinely pluralistic democracy. Beginning with contemporary effects to reckon with the legacy of white supremacy in America, Jones returns to the fateful year when a little-known church doctrine emerged that shaped the way five centuries of European Christians would understand the \u201cdiscovered\u201d world and the people who populated it. Along the way, he shows us the connections between Emmett Till and the Spanish conquistador Hernando De Soto in the Mississippi Delta, between the lynching of three Black circus workers in Duluth and the mass execution of thirty-eight Dakota men in Makato, and between the murder of 300 African Americans during the burning of Black Wall Street in Tulsa and the Trail of Tears. From this vantage point, Jones offers a \u201crevelatory\u2026searing, stirring outline\u201d (Kirkus Reviews, starred review) of how the enslavement of Africans was not America\u2019s original sin but, rather, the continuation of acts of genocide and dispossession flowing from the first European contact with Native Americans. These deeds were justified by people who embraced the 15th-century Doctrine of Discovery: the belief that God had designated all territory not inhabited or controlled by Christians as their new promised land. This \u201cblistering, bracing, and brave\u201d (Michael Eric Dyson) reframing of American origins explains how the founders of the United States could build the philosophical framework for a democratic society on a foundation of mass racial violence\u2014and why this paradox survives today in the form of white Christian nationalism. Through stories of people navigating these contradictions in three communities, Jones illuminates the possibility of a new American future in which we finally fulfill the promise of a pluralistic democracy."

        "summary": "Stories are everywhere, from fiction across media to politics and personal identity. Handbook of Narrative Analysis sorts out both traditional and recent narrative theories, providing the necessary skills to interpret any story. In addition to discussing classical theorists, such as G\u00e9rard Genette, Mieke Bal, and Seymour Chatman, Handbook of Narrative Analysis presents precursors (such as E. M. Forster), related theorists (Franz Stanzel, Dorrit Cohn), and a large variety of postclassical critics. Among the latter particular attention is paid to rhetorical, cognitive, and cultural approaches; intermediality; storyworlds; gender theory; and natural and unnatural narratology. Not content to consider theory as an end in itself, Luc Herman and Bart Vervaeck use two short stories and a graphic narrative by contemporary authors as touchstones to illustrate each approach to narrative. In doing so they illuminate the practical implications of theoretical preferences and the ideological leanings underlying them. Marginal glosses guide the reader through discussions of theoretical issues, and an extensive bibliography points readers to the most current publications in the field. Written in an accessible style, this handbook combines a comprehensive treatment of its subject with a user-friendly format appropriate for specialists and nonspecialists alike. Handbook of Narrative Analysis is the go-to book for understanding and interpreting narrative. This new edition revises and extends the first edition to describe and apply the last fifteen years of cutting-edge scholarship in the field of narrative theory."

        "summary": "War is often described as an extension of politics by violent means. With contributions from twenty-eight eminent historians, Volume 2 of The Cambridge History of the Second World War examines the relationship between ideology and politics in the war's origins, dynamics and consequences. Part I examines the ideologies of the combatants and shows how the war can be understood as a struggle of words, ideas and values with the rival powers expressing divergent claims to justice and controlling news from the front in order to sustain moral and influence international opinion. Part II looks at politics from the perspective of pre-war and wartime diplomacy as well as examining the way in which neutrals were treated and behaved. The volume concludes by assessing the impact of states, politics and ideology on the fate of individuals as occupied and liberated peoples, collaborators and resistors, and as British and French colonial subjects."

        "summary": "This volume features a set of thought-provoking and long overdue approaches to situating Stanley Kubrick's films in contemporary debates around gender, race, and age - with a focus on women's representations. Offering new historical and critical perspectives on Kubrick's cinema, the book asks how his work should be viewed bearing in mind issues of gender equality, sexual harassment, and abuse. The authors tackle issues such as Kubrick's at times questionable relationships with his actresses and former wives, the dynamics of power, misogyny and miscegenation in his films, and auteur 'apologism', among others. The selection delineates these complex contours of Kubrick's work by drawing on archival sources, engaging in close readings of specific films, and exploring Kubrick through unorthodox venture points. With an interdisciplinary scope and social justice-centered focus, this book offers new perspectives on a well-established area of study. It will appeal to scholars and upper-level students of film studies, media studies, gender studies, and visual culture, as well as to fans of the director interested in revisiting his work with a new perspective."

Compliance emerges as more than the opposite of resistance: instead, it appears as a valuable heuristic approach for understanding collective life, as these means by which actors strive to accommodate themselves to others. This perspective transcends conventional distinctions between power and resistance, and offers to open up new avenues of anthropological enquiry."

        "summary": "Science and illustration have always walked hand in hand, and not only the scientific community but the general public as well have used images since early history to understand natural phenomena. Moreover, from Galileo to Einstein, our modern history has been written with the key support of art and with all the insights it contributes. This XL-sized book collects more than 300 graphic works that range from original sketches to technical drawings, and from meticulous hand illustrations to computer-generated images. The Western scientific revolution that started in the 14th century catapulted humankind into a completely new way of understanding how nature and the world around us behaved. Whether it was diseases caused by viruses or the vast galaxies of the cosmos, a new army of professionals turned their minds to unlocking and reshaping the universe of our experience with a dialectic positioned between theory and evidence. The field of illustration and the development of knowledge became inseparably intertwined, as can be seen by the majestic works shown in this book that were produced by the scientists and artists who specialized in this combined field. Explore here the work of more than 700 scientists and over 300 discoveries in anatomy, physics, chemistry, astronomy, mechanics, and many other scientific fields, through the visual works that bring them to life. Combined with detailed texts explaining their scientific significance, the illustrations in this book introduce the work of such pionieering scientists as Andreas Vesalius, Isaac Newton, Marie Curie, and Rosalind Franklin. The visualizations themselves present game-changing ideas and discoveries from the 15th century to the present day, notably including Galileo's watercolors of the moon, Bourgery's unparalleled Atlas of Human Anatomy and Surgery, Florence Nightingale's statistical diagrams to indicate war casualties, and Einstein's quickly scribbled ideas for his general theory of relativity. Many discoveries in science take place as the result of counterintuitive thinking, and in order to visualize their work scientists have to connect with the resources of collective knowledge and in turn convey new information back to people. This book is for everyone who is continually amazed by the wonders of our world and who wants to find out more about it through the remarkable illustrations used to present advances in scientific understanding."

        "summary": "Newly reimagined edition of Alex Webb's now-classic and long out-of-print Dislocations Dislocations presents a contemporary update of Alex Webb's long out-of-print 1998 book by the same name, which was first published by Harvard's Film Study Center as an experiment in alternative book making. The book brought together pictures from the many disparate locations over Webb's oeuvre, meditating on the act of photography as a form of dislocation in itself. Dislocations was instantly collectable and continues to be sought after today. Webb returned to the idea of dislocation during the pandemic, looking at images produced in the twenty years since the original publication--as well as looking back at that first edition. Dislocations expands a beloved limited edition with unpublished images that speak to today's sense of displacement. As a series of pictures that would have been impossible to create in a world dominated by closed borders and disrupted travel, it continues to resonate as the world resets."

        "summary": "A sweeping survey of hip hop's resounding impact on contemporary art and culture across the past 20-plus years Accompanying a groundbreaking exhibition originating at the Baltimore Museum of Art, this book captures the extraordinary influence of hip hop, which has driven innovations in music, visual and performing arts, fashion, and technology and grown into a global phenomenon since its emergence in the 1970s. It features approximately 70 objects by both established and emerging artists, design houses, streetwear icons and musicians working in a wide range of mediums to demonstrate hip-hop's proliferation from the street to the runway, the studio to the museum gallery, and countless sites in between. The exhibition also explores how hip hop has and continues to challenge structures of power, dominant cultural narratives, and political and social systems of oppression. This fully illustrated monograph documents the exhibition and contains texts and interviews from more than 30 artists and scholars. Artists include: Nina Chanel Abney, Derrick Adams, Anthony Olubunmi Akinbola, Dionne Alexander, Maxwell Alexandre, Devin Allen, Bruno Baptistelli, Alvaro Barrington, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Grace Wales Bonner, Mark Bradford, Jordan Casteel, Jonathan Lyndon Chase, Willy Chavarria, Caitlin Cherry, Troy Chew II, Kudzanai Chiurai, Telfar Clemens, Larry Cook, William Cordova, Carl Jones, Damon Davis, Alex de Mora, Stan Douglas, John Edmonds, Jen Everett, Aaron Fowler, Gajin Fujita, Nicholas Galanin, Luis Gispert, Hassan Hajjaj, Lauren Halsey, Robert Hodge, Monica Ikegwu, Kahlil Robert Irving, Kahlil Robert Irving, Shabez Jamal, Kahlil Joseph, Nia June, LA II, Deana Lawson, El Franco Lee II, Amani Lewis, Megan Lewis, Ma\u00ef Lucas, Miguel Luciano, Roberto Lugo, Eric N.

        "summary": "Large-scale textile works from a leading contemporary Afro-Caribbean American artist. This is the first volume to document and contextualize Sonya Clark's large-scale, community-centric and collaborative artworks. These projects demonstrate Clark's career-long commitment to addressing the urgent issue of racial inequality in American society and her philosophy of creatively engaging the viewer in reflection on the nation's history of slavery and our roles in dismantling systemic racism today. As an extension of her abiding commitment to issues of history, race, and reconciliation in her work, Clark is also distinctive as an artist for her use of textiles and other everyday materials, which she aligns with the intertwined histories of art and craft. For marginalized people (African Americans and women, in particular) handwork has been essential to survival and consequently has functioned, and continues to function, as an important means of creating a group identity. Hence, for Clark, craft is essential to the question of equality."

What do a fly and a mulberry have in common? What utopias await in unexplored corners of the earth and beyond? During the Enlightenment, questions like these were brought to life through an astonishing array of prints and drawings, helping shape public opinion and stir political change. Dare to Know overturns common assumptions about the age, using the era's proliferation of works on paper to tell a more nuanced story. Echoing the structure and sweep of Diderot's Encyclop\u00e9die, the book contains 26 thematic essays, organized A to Z, providing an unprecedented perspective on more than 50 artists, including Henry Fuseli, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, Francisco Goya, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, William Hogarth, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, and Giambattista Tiepolo. With a multidisciplinary approach, the book probes developments in the natural sciences, technology, economics, and more--all through the lens of the graphic arts."

        "summary": "An eye-opening account of a world order shaped by spacepower and the threat of space warfare. Space technology was developed to enhance the killing power of the state. The Moon landings and the launch of the Space Shuttle were mere sideshows, drawing public attention away from the real goal: military and economic control of space as a source of power on Earth. Today, as Bleddyn E. Bowen vividly recounts, thousands of satellites work silently in the background to provide essential military, intelligence and economic capabilities. No major power can do without them. Beyond Washington, Moscow and Beijing, truly global technologies have evolved, from the ground floor of the nuclear missile revolution to today's orbital battlefield, shaping the wars to come. World powers including India, Japan and Europe are fully realising the strategic benefits of commanding Earth's 'cosmic coastline', as a stage for war, development and prestige. Yet, as new contenders spend more and more on outer space, there is scope for cautious optimism about the future of the Space Age--if we can recognise, rather than hide, its original sin."

        "summary": "Exposing ethical dilemmas of neuroscientific research on violence, this book warns against a dystopian future in which behavior is narrowly defined in relation to our biological makeup. Biological explanations for violence have existed for centuries, as has criticism of this kind of deterministic science, haunted by a long history of horrific abuse. Yet, this program has endured because of, and not despite, its notorious legacy. Today's scientists are well beyond the nature versus nurture debate. Instead, they contend that scientific progress has led to a natureandnurture, biological and social, stance that allows it to avoid the pitfalls of the past. In Conviction, Oliver Rollins cautions against this optimism, arguing that the way these categories are imagined belies a dangerous continuity between past and present. The late 80s ushered in a wave of techno-scientific advancements in the genetic and brain sciences. Rollins focuses on an often-ignored strand of research, the neuroscience of violence, which he argues became a key player in the larger conversation about the biological origins of criminal, violent behavior. Using powerful technologies, neuroscientists have rationalized an idea of the violent brain--or a brain that bears the marks of predisposition towards \"dangerousness.\" Drawing on extensive analysis of neurobiological research, interviews with neuroscientists, and participant observation, Rollins finds that this construct of the brain is ill-equipped to deal with the complexities and contradictions of the social world, much less the ethical implications of informing treatment based on such simplified definitions. Rollins warns of the potentially devastating effects of a science that promises to \"predict\" criminals before the crime is committed, in a world that already understands violence largely through a politic of inequality."

It also examines critiques of these games within the gamer communities and beyond. Drawing on a range of international contributions, examples and case studies, this book shows how colonialism-themed games work as representations of the past that are influenced by existing heritage narratives and discourses. It also considers the implications of using colonial histories in games and its impact on its audience, the games' players. Heritage, Memory and Identity in Postcolonial Board Games will be relevant to scholars and postgraduate students in the fields of game studies, game design or development, heritage studies, postcolonial criticism, media studies, and history. It will also be beneficial to practicing game developers."

        "summary": "This book will help game designers and those interested in games thoughtfully embed culture into video games and the game design process. This book raises the issue of how some cultures and communities are misrepresented within various video games. In response to this problem, designers can bring cultural considerations and practices into the centre focus of the game design process. The book advocates that designers put different measures in place to better prevent misrepresentations and engage with deeper understandings of culture to build culturally richer and more meaningful game worlds. The book uses the Torres Strait Virtual Reality project as a primary example in addition to other game projects to explore cultural representation in game design. Torres Strait culture is also explored and discussed more broadly throughout the book. No prior knowledge of culture studies is needed, and the book deals with higher level game design with little reference to the technical elements of game development. This unique and timely book will appeal to those interested in the implications of cultural depictions in video games and opportunities to generate deeper cultural representations through the game design process."

        "summary": "Why do contemporary queer theatre and performance appear to be possessed by the past? What aesthetic practices and dramaturgical devices reveal the occupation of the present by painful history? How might the experience of theatre and performance relieve the present of its most arduous burdens? Following recent legislation and cultural initiatives across many Western countries that suggest the darkest days for LGBTQ+ people are over, this book turns our attention to artists who invoke history's enduring harm. Guiding us through an eclectic range of examples that includes Artangel, Cassils, David Hoyle, Dickie Beau, Franko B, Jeremy O. Harris, Karen Finley, les ballets C de la B, McDermott & McGough, Milo Rau, Rachel Mars, Split Britches and Travis Alabanza, Walsh explores how this work reckons with the incarceration and untimely death of Oscar Wilde, the Holocaust, racial objectification, the AIDS crisis and covid-19, alongside more local and personal experiences of violence, trauma and grief. Walsh deftly traces how these histories are summoned and interrogated via what he elaborates as aesthetics and dramaturgies of possession, which lend form to the still-stinging aches and generative potential of injustice and loss. These strategies expose how the past continues to haunt a wishfully timeless present, while calling on those of us who feel its force to tend to history's unresolved hurt."

        "summary": "Performance in Popular Culture reveals the intricate relationship between performance and popular culture by exploring how theatrical conventions and dramaturgical tropes have informed the way the social is constructed for popular consumption. Staged as a series of case studies, this book considers the diverse ways the social is imagined and produced in live and mediated performances, in images and texts, in interactive experiences and in cultural institutions. By looking at performance in popular culture, the world we live in becomes more visible, open to investigation and (perhaps) to change. Performance in Popular Culture engages a wide range of disciplines and theoretical frameworks: performance, theatre and cultural studies; comparative literature and media studies; gender and sexuality, critical race and post-colonial theories. Designed for accessibility at an undergraduate level, the case studies make use of visual materials, moving images and texts that are readily available to lecturers and students, to scholars and to the general public."

From 2015 to 2020, intimacy choreography transformed from a grassroots movement in experimental and regional theaters into a best practice accepted in Hollywood and on Broadway. Today, intimacy choreographers have become a veritable \"intimacy industry\" in the cultural sphere, sparking attention from Rolling Stone to The New York Times to the sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live. This book analyzes the forces that have led to intimacy choreography\u2019s meteoric rise and asks what implications the field has for theater practice more broadly. Building a theoretical framework for intimacy directing, Directing Desire also strives to reorient the conversation in the field so that artists understand not only best practices in consent but also intersectional frameworks that expand and rework consent."

While the study of media industries is a focal point at many universities around the world \u2013 promising, as it might, rich dialogues between academia and industry \u2013 understandings of the actual methodologies for researching the media industries remain vague. What are the best methods for analysing the workings of media industries \u2013 and how does one navigate those methods in light of complex deterrents like copyright and policy, not to mention the difficulty of gaining access to the media industries? Responding to these questions, Industrial Approaches to Media offers practical, theoretical, and ethical principles for the field of media industry studies, providing its first full methodological exploration. It features key scholars such as Henry Jenkins, Michele Hilmes, Paul McDonald and Alisa Perren."

        "summary": "\"We argue that ideology lacks meaning in the United States: what is conservative and liberal is that which Republicans and Democrats have labeled \"conservative,\" and \"liberal.\" This premise is central to how we understand the role of the political parties in American political behavior and why political party leaders are so essential to crafting the beliefs of partisans in the electorate. Second, we trace how the parties have evolved on issues over time, highlighting the lack of ideological consistency in the party platforms. We then explain how negative partisanship and partisan-motivated reasoning create a situation where partisans are psychologically rewarded for adopting the party's position and being receptive to information from their own party while blocking information from other sources\"--"

        "summary": "Perspectives from worldwide experts on how major cities across the globe are responding to the major environmental threats of our time, including global climate change Over half of the world's population now lives in cities, and this share is expected to increase in the coming decades. With growing urbanization, cities and their residents face substantial environmental challenges such as higher temperatures, droughts, wildfires, and increased flooding. In response to these pressing challenges, some cities have begun to develop local environmental regulations that supplement national and environmental laws. In so doing, cities have stepped into a role that has been historically dominated by higher levels of government.Global Sustainable Cities takes stock of the policies that have been implemented by cities around the world in recent years in several key areas: water, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate adaptation. It examines the advantages--and potential drawbacks--of allowing cities to assume a significant role in environmental regulation, given the legal and political constraints in which cities operate.The contributors present a series of case studies of the actions that seven leading cities--Abu Dhabi, Beijing, Berlin, Delhi, London, New York, and Shanghai--are taking to improve their environments and adapt to climate change. The first volume of its kind, Global Sustainable Cities is a critical comparative assessment of the actions that major cities in the global North and South are taking to advance sustainability."

        "summary": "This is the first academic book in English to closely examine the life of Diego Maradona from socio-cultural perspectives, exploring how his status as an icon, a popular sporting hero and a political figurehead have been culturally constructed, reproduced, and manipulated. The book looks at representations of Maradona across a wide variety of media, including literature, cinema, popular music, printed and online press, and radio, and in different countries around the world, to cast new light on topics such as the instrumentality of sporting heroes and the links between sport, nationalism and ideology. It shows how the life of Maradona - from his origins in the barrio through to his rise to god-like status in Naples and as a postcolonial symbol of courage and resistance against imperial powers across the global south, alongside scandal and his fall from grace - powerfully illustrates themes such as the dynamics of gender, justice and affect that underpin the study of sport, culture and society. This is essential reading for anybody with an interest in football, sport studies, media studies, cultural studies or sociology."

        "summary": "In the 1880s, a new medical term flashed briefly into public awareness in the United States. Children who had trouble distinguishing between similar speech sounds were said to suffer from \"sound-blindness.\" The term is now best remembered through anthropologist Franz Boas, whose work deeply influenced the way we talk about cultural difference. In this fascinating work of literary and cultural history, Alex Benson takes the concept as an opening onto other stories of listening, writing, and power--stories that expand our sense of how a syllable, a word, a gesture, or a song can be put into print, and why it matters. Benson interweaves ethnographies, memoirs, local-color stories, modernist novels, silent film scripts, and more. Taken together, these seemingly disparate texts--by writers including John M. Oskison, Helen Keller, W. E. B. Du Bois, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Elsie Clews Parsons--show that the act of transcription, never neutral, is conditioned by the histories of race, land, and ability. By carefully tracing these conditions, Benson argues, we can tease out much that has been left off the record in narratives of American nationhood and American literature."

        "summary": "The Constitutional Revolution of 1906 launched Iran as a pioneer in a broad-based movement to establish democratic rule in the non-Western world. In a book that provides essential context for understanding modern Iran, Fakhreddin Azimi traces a century of struggle for the establishment of representative government. The promise of constitutional rule was cut short in the 1920s with the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty. Reza Shah, whose despotic rule Azimi deftly captures, maintained the fa\u00e7ade of a constitutional monarch but greeted any challenge with an iron fist: \u201cI will eliminate you,\u201d he routinely barked at his officials. In 1941, fearful of losing control of the oil-rich region, the Allies forced Reza Shah to abdicate but allowed Mohammad Reza to succeed his father. Though promising to abide by the constitution, the new Shah missed no opportunity to undermine it. The Anglo-American\u2013backed coup of 1953, which ousted reformist premier Mohammed Mosaddeq, dealt a blow to the constitutionalists. The Shah\u2019s repressive policies and subservience to the United States radicalized both secular and religious opponents, leading to the revolution of 1979. Azimi argues that we have fundamentally misunderstood this event by characterizing it as an \u201cIslamic\u201d revolution when it was in reality the expression of a long-repressed desire for popular sovereignty. This explains why the clerical rulers have failed to counter the growing public conviction that the Islamic Republic, too, is impervious to political reform\u2014and why the democratic impulse that began with the Constitutional Revolution continues to be a potent and resilient force."

        "summary": "Philip II of Spain was a major patron of the arts, best known for his magnificent palace and royal mausoleum at the Monastery of San Lorenzo of El Escorial. However, neither the king's monastery nor his collections fully convey his participation in the rich artistic landscape of Spain's \"Golden Age.\" In this book, Laura Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez examines Philip's architectural and artistic projects, placing them within the wider context of Europe and the transoceanic Iberian dominions. Philip II of Spain and the Architecture of Empire investigates ideas of hybridity, empire, and globalization in the art and architecture of the Iberian world during the sixteenth century, a time when the Spanish Empire was the largest composite monarchy in the world. Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez illuminates Philip's use of building regulations to construct an imperial city in Madrid and highlights the importance of his reform of the Simancas fortress into an archive. She analyzes the refashioning of his imperial image upon his ascension to the Portuguese throne and uses the Hall of Battles in El Escorial as a lens through which to understand visual culture, history writing, and Philip's kingly image as it was reflected in the funeral commemorations mourning his death across the Iberian world. Positioning Philip's art and architectural programs within the wider cultural context of politics, legislation, religion, and theoretical trends, Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez shows how design and images traveled across the Iberian world and offers a nuanced assessment of Philip's role in influencing them. Original and important, this panoramic new work will have a lasting impact on Philip II's artistic legacy. Art historians and scholars of Iberia and sixteenth-century history especially will value Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez's research."

        "summary": "As issues in American law turn up with ever-greater frequency in dozens of countries worldwide, some familiarity with the legal system of the United States of America has become de rigueur for practising lawyers everywhere. This incomparable handbook, now in its Second Edition, provides an authoritative description of the major elements, including all matters likely to emerge in the course of normal legal activity. Written from a clear and cogent comparative perspective, it is of great practical value for both counselling and courtroom use. Eighteen lucid chapters by distinguished American law professors, each of whom is also knowledgeable about a legal system outside that of the United States, explain the major laws, legal standards, and legal institutions of the United States. Substantive and procedural comparisons are presented in plain English, with appropriate commentary where deemed helpful to clarify particularly complex or unsettled matters. The resulting volume is an expert historical, systematic, and critical introduction to the law of the United States."

        "summary": "The bestselling, award-winning author of The Power delivers a dazzling tour de force where a handful of friends plot a daring heist to save the world from the tech giants whose greed threatens life as we know it. When Martha Einkorn fled her father\u2019s isolated compound in Oregon, she never expected to find herself working for a powerful social media mogul hell-bent on controlling everything. Now, she\u2019s surrounded by mega-rich companies designing private weather, predictive analytics, and covert weaponry, while spouting technological prophecy. Martha may have left the cult, but if the apocalyptic warnings in her father\u2019s fox and rabbit sermon\u2014once a parable to her\u2014are starting to come true, how much future is actually left? Across the world, in a mall in Singapore, Lai Zhen, an internet-famous survivalist, flees from an assassin. She\u2019s cornered, desperate and\u2014worst of all\u2014might die without ever knowing what's going on. Suddenly, a remarkable piece of software appears on her phone telling her exactly how to escape. Who made it? What is it really for? And if those behind it can save her from danger, what do they want from her, and what else do they know about the future? Martha and Zhen\u2019s worlds are about to collide. An explosive chain of events is set in motion. While a few billionaires assured of their own safety lead the world to destruction, Martha\u2019s relentless drive and Zhen\u2019s insatiable curiosity could lead to something beautiful or the cataclysmic end of civilization. By turns thrilling, hilarious, tender, and always piercingly brilliant, The Future unfolds at a breakneck speed, highlighting how power corrupts the few who have it and what it means to stand up to them. The future is coming. The Future is here."

        "summary": "Finalist for the National Book Award, 2023 With Tripas, Brandon Som follows up his award-winning debut with a book of poems built out of a multicultural, multigenerational childhood home, in which he celebrates his Chicana grandmother, who worked nights on the assembly line at Motorola, and his Chinese American father and grandparents, who ran the family corner store. Enacting a c\u00f3mo se dice poetics, a dialogic poem-making that inventively listens to heritage languages and transcribes family memory, Som participates in a practice of mem(oir), placing each poem's ear toward a confluence of history, labor, and languages, while also enacting a kind of \"telephone\" between cultures. Invested in the circuitry and circuitous routes of migration and labor, Som's lyricism weaves together the narratives of his transnational communities, bringing to light what is overshadowed in the reckless transit of global capitalism and imagining a world otherwise-one attuned to the echo in the hecho, the oracle in the \u00f3rale."

Part One sets out the English School\u2019s origins and development, explaining its central concepts and methodological tools, and placing it within the broader canon of IR theory. Part Two offers a detailed account of the historical, regional and social structural strands of the English School, explaining the important link between the school\u2019s historical projects and its interest in a societal approach to international relations. Part Three explores the School\u2019s responses to the enduring problems of order and justice, and highlights the changing balance between pluralist and solidarist institutions in the evolution of international society over the past five centuries. The book concludes with a discussion of the English School\u2019s ongoing controversies and debates, and identifies opportunities for further research. For students new to the topic this book will provide an accessible and balanced overview, whilst those already familiar with the ES will be prompted to look afresh at their own understanding of its significance and potentiality."

Particular focus is given to advances within the industry during this time, such as new technologies, innovative gameplay, never-before-seen graphics, and design. An introduction by Simon Parkin provides an overview of gaming history, and exploring how iconic games have pushed the boundaries of the medium and 300 entries, hand picked by a panel of industry experts, showcase the most influential and celebrated games, consoles, publishers, and more. Each entry is accompanied by text informing the reader about the game and its history, its place in wider popular culture, and including useful information and facts, with exciting and sometimes unexpected pairings provided by the A to Z organisation. A glossary of key words and select biographies of influential creators and developers provides more context and a system of icons and infographics allows readers to see the connections between the book's 300 entries. Wider gaming culture, and how it has grown from a niche hobby to a worldwide phenomenon, influencing popular culture, is also explored, making this the widest ranging survey of games and gaming available today."

        "summary": "\"A feral child finds a family. An old bottle washes up with a note inside. A boy's stuffed elephant flies out the car window. Over two decades, Lane DeGregory's stories of ordinary people struggling with love and loss, pain and perseverance, have earned her a Pulitzer Prize for feature writing and enhanced the Tampa Bay (formerly St. Petersburg) Times's reputation for publishing pioneering literary nonfiction. DeGregory has also built a worldwide fan base not just among readers of the Times but among journalists and narrative writers of all stripes, who seek out her advice on how to find, report, and write compelling true narratives. This volume collects for the first time twenty-four of her best stories, each accompanied by behind-the-scenes notes about how she convinced that person to speak to her, got that memorable quote, built that evocative scene. The book's unique format makes it both an anthology for readers who love her stories and a guide to craft for those who want to write their own. It includes a foreword by Beth Macy, author of Dopesick, introducing readers who have not yet discovered DeGregory to her creative and inspiring body of work\"--"

This diversity of perspectives presents a challenge to the instructor of a real estate principles course. Depending on their backgrounds and training and on the interests of the students, some instructors may choose to emphasize the legal concepts that define and limit the potential value of real estate. Other instructors may focus more on licensing and brokerage issues (popular topics with many students) or on the investment decision-making process. Still others may feel that real estate market and feasibility analysis should be the core topics in a principles class. In short, one of the difficulties in teaching an introductory real estate course is that there appear to be too many \"principles.\" The critical question thus becomes: What framework should be used to teach these principles?\"--"

        "summary": "One Sunday afternoon in February 1977, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, Ntozake Shange, and several other Black women writers met at June Jordan's Brooklyn apartment to eat gumbo, drink champagne, and talk about their work. Calling themselves \"The Sisterhood,\" the group--which also came to include Audre Lorde, Paule Marshall, Margo Jefferson, and others--would get together once a month over the next two years, creating a vital space for Black women to discuss literature and liberation. The Sisterhood tells the story of how this remarkable community transformed American writing and cultural institutions. Drawing on original interviews with Sisterhood members as well as correspondence, meeting minutes, and close readings of their works, Courtney Thorsson explores the group's everyday collaboration and profound legacy. The Sisterhood advocated for Black women writers at trade publishers and magazines such as Random House, Ms., and Essence, and eventually in academic departments as well--even in the face of sexist, racist, and homophobic backlash. Thorsson traces the personal, professional, and political ties that brought the group together as well as the reasons for its dissolution. She considers the popular and critical success of Sisterhood members in the 1980s, the uneasy absorption of Black feminism into the academy, and the younger writers building on the foundations the group laid. Highlighting the organizing and community building that nurtured Black women's writing, this book demonstrates that The Sisterhood offers an enduring model for Black feminist collaboration."

        "summary": "What can the life writing of post-famine Irish immigrants tell us about Irish diasporic memory? Of Memory and the Misplaced draws from the writing of previously unknown immigrants to contest conventional narratives about the Irish in North America. Analyzing over 30 memoirs written between 1900 and 1970, Sarah O'Brien demonstrates how ordinary immigrants subverted the typical grand narratives of Irish nationalism to tell their own story, on their own terms. Using cultural history and linguistics, O'Brien highlights US influence on Irish immigrants, who were able to explore taboo themes such as domestic violence, same-sex love, and famine-induced trauma. Importantly, Of Memory and the Misplaced also critiques the romanticized idea of the Irish landscape as a site of cultural memory and shows how the interiority of the domestic world provided women with the language needed to reclaim their own lives. By combining literary and historical theory with memory studies, Of Memory and the Misplaced highlights voices that have traditionally been silenced and offers a rare and unexplored collection of primary source autobiographical texts to better understand the experiences of Irish immigrants in the United States."

        "summary": "A reckoning with one of our most beloved art forms, whose past and present are shaped by gender, racial, and class inequities--and a look inside the fight for its future Every day, in dance studios all across America, legions of little children line up at the barre to take ballet class. This time in the studio shapes their lives, instilling lessons about gender, power, bodies, and their place in the world both in and outside of dance. In Turning Pointe, journalist Chloe Angyal captures the intense love for ballet that so many dancers feel, while also grappling with its devastating shortcomings: the power imbalance of an art form performed mostly by women, but dominated by men; the impossible standards of beauty and thinness; and the racism that keeps so many people of color out of ballet. As the rigid traditions of ballet grow increasingly out of step with the modern world, a new generation of dancers is confronting these issues head on, in the studio and on stage. For ballet to survive the twenty-first century and forge a path into a more socially just future, this reckoning is essential."

        "summary": "Today, gun control is one of the most polarizing topics in American politics. However, before the 1960s, positions on firearms rights did not necessarily map onto partisan affiliation. What explains this drastic shift? Patrick J. Charles charts the rise of gun rights activism from the early twentieth century through the 1980 presidential election, pinpointing the role of the 1968 Gun Control Act. Gun rights advocates including the National Rifle Association had lobbied legislators for decades, but they had cast firearms control as a local issue. After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 spurred congressional proposals to regulate firearms, gun rights advocates found common cause with states' rights proponents opposed to civil rights legislation. Following the enactment of the Gun Control Act, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle began to stake out firm positions. Politicians including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan recognized the potential of gun control as a wedge issue, and gun rights became increasingly tied to the Republican Party. Drawing on a vast range of archival evidence, Charles offers new insight into the evolution of the gun rights movement and how politicians responded to anti-gun control hardliners. He examines in detail how the National Rifle Association reinvented itself as well as how other advocacy groups challenged the NRA's political monopoly. Offering a deep dive into the politicization of gun rights, Vote Gun reveals the origins of the acrimonious divisions that persist to this day."

        "summary": "Racial Opportunity Cost turns critical attention to the specific challenges faced by high-achieving students of color and gives educators a framework for recognizing and addressing these issues. Terah T. Venzant Chambers roots her discussion in the concept of racial opportunity cost, using a term borrowed from economics to refer to the obstacles faced and tradeoffs made by Black and Latinx students on the path to academic success. Gathering first-hand accounts from students, practitioners, and researchers, Chambers underscores a set of experiences common to academically successful students from racially minoritized backgrounds, especially those who attend predominantly white schools. These individual testimonies collectively show how, despite their successes, high-achieving students of color regularly encounter educational racism. As their experiences reveal, their academic progress may also be impeded by secondary stressors such as peer and cultural isolation and struggles with racial identity. These personal accounts illustrate the many ways in which the negative effects of racial opportunity cost extend from K-12 education into postsecondary academics and beyond. In this clarifying work, Chambers identifies the factors, such as school culture, intersectionality, and community acceptance that can increase or lessen racial opportunity cost across educational environments. She considers how the individual challenges that high-achieving and high-ability students of color confront reflect larger systemic problems. Chambers' framework will help educators proactively cultivate change in their classrooms and schools so that they may lower racial opportunity cost and improve student experiences."

        "summary": "The invocation of fifth columns in the political arena -- whether contrived or based on real fears -- has recurred periodically throughout history and is experiencing an upsurge in our era of democratic erosion and geopolitical uncertainty. Fifth columns accusations can have baleful effects on governance and trust, as they call into question the loyalty and belonging of the targeted populations. They can cause human rights abuses, political repression, and even ethnic cleansing. Enemies Within is the first book to systematically investigate the roots and implications of the politics of fifth columns. In this volume, a multidisciplinary group of leading scholars address several related questions: When are actors likely to employ fifth-column claims and against whom? What accounts for changes in fifth-column framing over time? How do the claims and rhetoric of governments differ from those of societal groups? How do accusations against ethnically or ideologically defined groups differ? Finally, how do actors labeled as fifth columns respond? To answer these questions, the contributors apply a common theoretical framework and work within the tradition of qualitative social science to analyze cases from three continents, oftentimes challenging conventional wisdom. Enemies Within offers a unique perspective to better understand contemporary challenges including the rise of populism and authoritarianism, the return of chauvinistic nationalism, the weakening of democratic norms, and the persecution of ethnic or religious minorities and political dissidents."

Written by leading ES scholar Barry Buzan, it expertly guides readers through the English School\u2019s formative ideas, intellectual and historical roots, current controversies and future avenues of development. Part One sets out the English School\u2019s origins and development, explaining its central concepts and methodological tools, and placing it within the broader canon of IR theory. Part Two offers a detailed account of the historical, regional and social structural strands of the English School, explaining the important link between the school\u2019s historical projects and its interest in a societal approach to international relations. Part Three explores the School\u2019s responses to the enduring problems of order and justice, and highlights the changing balance between pluralist and solidarist institutions in the evolution of international society over the past five centuries. The book concludes with a discussion of the English School\u2019s ongoing controversies and debates, and identifies opportunities for further research. For students new to the topic this book will provide an accessible and balanced overview, whilst those already familiar with the ES will be prompted to look afresh at their own understanding of its significance and potentiality."

        "summary": "Dark Traffic creates landmarks through language, by which its speakers begin to describe traumas in order to survive and move through them. With fine detail and observation, these poems work in some way like poetic weirs: readers of Kane\u2019s work will see the artic and subarctic, but also, more broadly, America, and the exigencies of motherhood, indigenous experience, feminism, and climate crises alongside the near-necropastoral of misogyny, violence, and systemic failures. These contexts catch the voice of the poems\u2019 speakers, and we perceive the currents they create."

        "summary": "This anthology explores the relationships and interdependencies between literary production and distinctions of taste by examining how the material aspects of literary texts, such as the cover, binding, typography, and paper stock, reflect or even determine their cultural status. In the nineteenth century, for example, the industrialization of printing made possible a wide range of cheap formats, such as dime novels, pulp magazines, and paperbacks, which made literature available to a mass reading public. The increased demand for new content effectively lowered the cultural entrance level, which resulted in a tremendous expansion of popular or trivial fiction. These developments were often perceived as a threat to traditional literary institutions, which increasingly relied on material distinctions as a way of preserving their cultural authority, and some publishers even attempted to mimic the conventions of exclusivity by creating deluxe editions that were designed to preserve the privileged status of so-called \"highbrow\" texts. In many cases, the distinctions between \"highbrow\" and \"lowbrow\" taste actually had little to do with the content of the texts themselves, as books more often functioned as markers of socioeconomic status, like clothing or home d\u00e9cor. At the risk of being provocative, one might even go so far as to say that the concept of literary taste was more closely related to fashion sense than critical judgment. The anthology seeks to address this claim by examining how the tensions between consumerism and prestige reflect fundamental historical changes with regard to the development of technology, literacy, and social power. The individual chapters cover a wide range of historical periods, genres, and national literatures, and they are divided into four sections that focus on different ways in which the materiality of literature is related to cultural prestige. The first section, \"Material Forms and Literary Publishing,\" focuses on how writers and publishers used the material properties of books to enhance their symbolic value and to challenge the idea of literature as a mass-produced commodity. These material strategies thus served to reinforce traditional distinctions of taste, which were closely aligned with the power of the literary elite, as the consumers of deluxe editions often sought to acquire respect and admiration within their social spheres. The second section, \"Material Distinctions in Popular Fiction,\" examines how the publishers of popular texts also used the material properties of books to enhance their symbolic and economic value, as works that were perceived as less prestigious were often more marketable, yet they could appeal to different groups of readers in different ways based on an alternative set of cultural distinctions. Instead of using books to signify their socioeconomic status, for example, fans of popular genre fiction more often fetishize special editions as a way of gaining prestige within their own reading communities. The third section, \"Cultural Prestige and Graphic Narratives,\" focuses on how the material properties of visual texts were also used to signify the differences between \"low\" and \"high\" art. The graphic novel format, for example, often served to enhance the status of previously lowbrow content by presenting it as a durable work that was worthy of being sold in bookstores and preserved in archives. The fourth and final section, \"Electronic Publishing and Reading Practices,\" also focuses on how new forms of electronic display are currently transforming the status of literary texts. While some contributors argue that e-books are potentially more prestigious than printed books, as they are less dependent on the economic imperatives of the publishing industry, others argue that printed books continue to serve a crucial non-literary function as markers of socioeconomic status. As with the other sections, therefore, the contributors in this section agree that distinctions of taste are still largely dependent on the materiality of literature, as the material properties of literary texts continue to reflect and influence their cultural prestige."

        "summary": "\"In Roe v. Wade, Justice Harry Blackmun structured the argument of the majority around the history of abortion laws. That history built on the work of law professor Cyril Means, Jr., and historian James Mohr. Means and Mohr proclaim four theses as summarizing the \"true\" history of abortion in England and America: (1) Abortion was not a crime \"at common law\" (before the enactment of abortion statutes in the nineteenth century. (2) Abortion was common and relatively safe during this time. (3) Abortion statutes were enacted in the nineteenth century in order to protect the life of the mother rather than the life of the embryo or fetus. (4) The moving force behind the nineteenth-century statutes was the attempt of the male medical profession to suppress competition from competing practitioners of alternative forms of medicine. This book dispels these myths and sets forth the true history of abortion and abortion law in English and American society. Anglo-American law always treated abortion as a serious crime, generally including early in pregnancy. Prosecutions and even executions go back 800 years in England, establishing law that carried over to colonial America. The reasons offered for these prosecutions and penalties consistently focused on protecting the life of the unborn child. This unbroken tradition refutes the claims that unborn children have not been treated as persons in our law or as persons under the Constitution of the United States\"--"

        "summary": "Despite the economic relevance of trade secrets, their legal protection is not based on a robust theoretical corpus, and a large uncertainty remains regarding how they should be legally apprehended. The present book investigates the foundations of their legal protection by assessing its justifications and aims to define how this legal apprehension should be organized. The book starts with a comparative analysis of the US and the EU legal frameworks. It demonstrates the parentship existing between the two systems of protection and highlights that the incremental structuring of trade secrets protection has led to legal systems lacking broad-based conceptual foundations. In both legal orders, trade secrets rely on blurred protection, formally anchored in unfair competition, the strength of which, however, comes closer to that offered by intellectual property law. In this convoluted architecture, the judiciary is required to play a decisive role, especially at the enforcement stage. However, the absence of clarity concerning the telos of trade secrets protection leads to legal uncertainty, potentially incoherent enforcement, and, all in all, to inefficient outcomes from a welfare perspective. The book then explores a theoretical framework based on a distinction between two legal objects: the undertakings\u2019 secret sphere and secret pieces of information. Securing the undertakings\u2019 secret sphere appears as a condition for the competition process to happen in an economy working under structural uncertainty. It requires objective regulations enforced by public authorities. On the other hand, the legal apprehension of secret pieces of information should be considered as falling within the realm of immaterial goods regulation aiming to solve the deficit of marketability of this type of good. This might call \u2013 after conducting a careful policy trade-off \u2013 for the establishment of relative (i.e. inter partes) subjective rights."

The outcomes of government policies depend in large part on how policies are executed and who is responsible for their execution. Public administration is the set of instruments -- the rules, incentives, organizations, information, systems and people -- to implement public policy. Public Administration: The Basics is a reader-friendly and up-to-date synthesis of the subject, complete with relatable examples, analogies, and real-world illustrations. The book, grounded on a sound conceptual basis, offers practical insight without jargon and, despite its short length, covers all major topics. The first three chapters describe the functions and organizational structure of government; the next three focus on the core issues of the management of public finances, government personnel, and public procurement; the final three chapters address government regulation, the provision of public services, and the interaction between government and the private sector. Public Administration: The Basics is an ideal first book for introductory public administration courses, as well as complementary reading for courses in political science, public economics and international affairs. The book also serves as an accessible reference for busy policymakers, civil servants and engaged citizens\"--"

        "summary": "\"This book explores resilience in urban neighborhoods affected by chronic conflict and violence, developing a new model for developing resilience. The neighborhood resilience approach is an inclusive form of building positive resilience, which recognizes that local communities possess valuable skills and experience of dealing with crises, and prioritizes the agency of local communities in the production of knowledge and developing practices. The book identifies and describes the repertoire of neighborhood resilience practices organized in four clusters: (1) addressing the structure of conflict; (2) increasing effectiveness of external resources; (3) enhancing community capacities; and (4) reflecting dynamics of identity and power in neighborhoods. One of the key findings of the book is that nonlinear connections between structure and dynamics of conflict and neighborhood resilience practices can be represented in the Four-Loop Model. The concentration on community-based practices addresses macro-level critiques of neo-liberalism in critical resilience studies and encourages rethinking the ways community-based indicators might operate in combination with existing macro indicators of resilience. The bottom-up indicators provide more specific details and essential localized experiences for improving resilience policies at the national level. This book will be of much interest to students of conflict resolution, resilience, urban studies and US politics\"--"

It continues to fill the need for a reference book for people working in the field of forensic molecular biology testing and research as well as individuals investigating and adjudicating cases involving DNA evidence, whether they be civil or criminal cases. DNA techniques have greatly impacted obvious traditional forensic areas, but such advances have also positively affected myriad new areas of research and inquiry. It is possible today to think about solving forensic problems that were simply unheard of even a few years ago. As such, the book pulls all relevant research and applied science together into a detailed and comprehensive collection. Part I begins with the history and development of DNA typing and profiling for criminal and civil purposes. It discusses the statistical interpretation of results with case examples, mitochondrial DNA testing, Y single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short tandem repeats (STRs), and X SNP and STR testing. It also explores low copy number DNA typing, mixtures, and quality assurance and control. Part II moves on to cover the various uses and applications of analyzing collected physical evidence, victim identification in mass disasters, analyzing animal DNA, forensic botany, and other unique applications. Part III is dedicated to the latest advances and developments in human molecular biology and Part IV looks at policies and laws and ethics governing DNA evidence, and its utilization in various cases and the courts. Forensic DNA Applications, Second Edition covers cutting-edge research and advancements in the field and is the most up-to-date reference available. Edited and contributed to by the world's foremost leaders in the field, it is a must-have reference for established professionals, and an essential resource to legal professionals-lawyers and judges dealing with civil and criminal cases involving DNA technology-as well as students entering the fields of genetics and forensic DNA analysis\"--"

It tracks when, why and how British and US police departments have adopted military tactics, tools and technologies for domestic use. It reveals that police militarization has occurred since the very founding of modern policing in the nineteenth century and that militarization has long been an effect of the imperial boomerang. When militarizing their forces, police officials have drawn upon the tactics, tools and technologies associated with imperialism and colonial conquests. Using the tools of comparative and postcolonial historical sociology, the book further shows that there have been distinct waves of militarization in Britain and the United States since the nineteenth century and that each of these waves have been triggered by the racialization of crime and disorder. Police have typically brought the imperial boomerang home to militarize police in response to perceived racialized threats from minority and immigrant populations. Police militarization results from the imperial state domesticating the methods and tools of its armies abroad to herd, contain and thrash imagined barbarians who have dared flood through the gates of ostensible civilization\"--"

As the Portuguese trading empire of the fifteenth and sixteenth century expanded sea-routes and networks from West Africa to India and the Far East, non-European cargoes were brought back to Renaissance Lisbon. Many rarities were earmarked for the Portuguese court, but simultaneously exclusive items were readily available for sale on the Rua Nova, the Lisbon equivalent of Bond Street or Fifth Avenue. Specialized shops offered West African and Ceylonese ivories, raffia and Asian textiles, rock crystals, Ming porcelain, Chinese and Ryukyuan lacquerware, jewellery, precious stones, naturalia and exotic animal byproducts. Lisbon was also a hub of distribution for overseas goods to other courts and cities in Europe. The cross-cultural and artistic influences between Lisbon and Portuguese Africa and Asia at this date will be re-assessed --"

By the faint light of your cheap flashlights, you see the stairs to the upper floor, its railings gnarled and broken like crooked teeth. Their curve makes the stairs seem almost like a hungry grin, and you wonder if their age will support your weight. Still, you must go in. The only question is who will go first? In Kids on Bikes, you'll take on the roles of everyday people grappling with strange, terrifying, and very, very powerful forces that they cannot defeat, control, or even fully understand. The only way to face them is to work together, use your strengths, and knmow when you just have to run as fast as you can. --"

        "summary": "Magnus Hirschfeld (1868-1935) was one of the first great pioneers of the gay liberation movement. Revered by such gay icons as Christopher Isherwood and Harry Hay, founder of the Mattachine Society, Hirschfeld\u2019s legacy resonates throughout the twentieth-century and around the world. Guided by his motto \u201cThrough Science Toward Justice,\u201d Hirschfeld helped found the Scientific Humanitarian Committee in Germany to defend the rights of homosexuals and develop a scientific framework for sexual equality. He was also an early champion of women\u2019s rights, campaigning in the early 1900s for the decriminalization of abortion and the right of female teachers and civil servants to marry and have children. By 1933 Hirschfeld\u2019s commitment to sexual liberation made him a target for the Nazis, and they ransacked his Institute for Sexual Research and publicly burned his books. This biography, first published to acclaim in Germany, follows Hirschfeld from his birth in the Prussian province of Pomerania to the heights of his career during the Weimar Republic and the rise of German fascism. Ralf Dose illuminates Hirschfeld\u2019s ground-breaking role in the gay liberation movement and explains some of his major theoretical concepts, which continue to influence our understanding of human sexuality and social justice today."

        "summary": "This book explores the forces that impelled China, the world\u2019s largest socialist state, to make massive changes in its domestic and international stance during the long 1970s. Fourteen distinguished scholars investigate the special, perhaps crucial part that the territory of Hong Kong played in encouraging and midwifing China\u2019s relationship with the non-Communist world. The Long 1970s were the years when China moved dramatically and decisively toward much closer relations with the non-Communist world. In the late 1970s, China also embarked on major economic reforms, designed to win it great power status by the early twenty-first centuries. The volume addresses the long-term implications of China\u2019s choices for the outcome of the Cold War and in steering the global international outlook toward free-market capitalism. Decisions made in the 1970s are key to understanding the nature and policies of the Chinese state today and the worldview of current Chinese leaders."

        "summary": "Library of America presents the biggest, most comprehensive trade edition of Frederick Douglass's writings ever published Edited by Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning biographer David W. Blight, this Library of America edition is the largest single-volume selection of Frederick Douglass\u2019s writings ever published, presenting the full texts of thirty-four speeches and sixty-seven pieces of journalism. (A companion Library of America volume, Frederick Douglass: Autobiographies, gathers his three memoirs.) With startling immediacy, these writings chart the evolution of Douglass\u2019s thinking about slavery and the U.S. Constitution; his eventual break with William Lloyd Garrison and many other abolitionists on the crucial issue of disunion; the course of his complicated relationship with Abraham Lincoln; and his deep engagement with the cause of women\u2019s suffrage. Here are such powerful works as \u201cWhat to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?,\u201d Douglass\u2019s incandescent jeremiad skewering the hypocrisy of the slaveholding republic; \u201cThe Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered,\u201d a full-throated refutation of nineteenthcentury racial pseudoscience; \u201cIs it Right and Wise to Kill a Kidnapper?,\u201d an urgent call for forceful opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act; \u201cHow to End the War,\u201d in which Douglass advocates, just days after the fall of Fort Sumter, for the raising of Black troops and the military destruction of slavery; \u201cThere Was a Right Side in the Late War,\u201d Douglass\u2019s no-holds-barred attack on the \u201cLost Cause\u201d mythology of the Confederacy; and \u201cLessons of the Hour,\u201d an impassioned denunciation of lynching and disenfranchisement in the emerging Jim Crow South. As a special feature the volume also presents Douglass\u2019s only foray into fiction, the 1853 novella \u201cThe Heroic Slave,\u201d about Madison Washington, leader of the real-life insurrection on board the domestic slave-trading ship Creole in 1841 that resulted in the liberation of more than a hundred enslaved people. Editorial features include detailed notes identifying Douglass\u2019s many scriptural and cultural references, a newly revised chronology of his life and career, and an index."

        "summary": "John Updike, at the peak of his powers, concludes his unforgettable Rabbit series and reimagines Hawthorne\u2019s Scarlet Letter for contemporary America The latest volume in Library of America\u2019s John Updike edition presents two essential novels by the master stylist of postwar American fiction. Roger\u2019s Version (1986) stakes out ground that encompasses Updike\u2019s recurring themes of sex, desire, and adultery as well as an emerging interest in the cosmic implications of contemporary scientific breakthroughs. In a dazzling refashioning of the love triangle at the heart of Hawthorne\u2019s The Scarlet Letter, twin adulteries unfold, revealing the heightened contrasts and inequalities of Ronald Reagan\u2019s America. Widely hailed upon publication as a masterpiece, awarded a Pulitzer and a National Book Critics Circle prize, Rabbit at Rest (1990) wraps up the saga of Updike\u2019s most enduring protagonist and concludes his \u201csurpassingly eloquent elegy for his country,\u201d in the words of Joyce Carol Oates. Now in his mid-fifties, the outwardly comfortable and complacent Harry Angstrom has settled into leisured obsolescence, dividing his time between Pennsylvania and the Valhalla Village retirement community in Florida. But alongside his golfing, junk-food consumption, and other forms of ease there loom unavoidable markers of Rabbit\u2019s human fragility and his mortality."

        "summary": "The Library of America's five-volume edition of Updike's novels culminates with three masterful late works: a brilliant exploration of the American Century; a reimagining of Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet; and a bittersweet coda to the Rabbit series The capstone volume of the Library of America edition of John Updike\u2019s novels contains some of the master stylist and social observer\u2019s most ambitious works. In the Beauty of the Lilies (1996) opens in 1910, when Clarence Wilmot, a Presbyterian minister in Paterson, NJ, experiences a devastating loss of faith. This moment of crisis sets in motion an eighty-year, multigenerational saga whose subject is nothing less than the American Century and modernity itself, seen through the fluctuating fortunes of a single representative family. In Gertrude and Claudius, Updike boldly imagines the long backstory to the world\u2019s most famous play, prompting readers to revisit and perhaps revise their judgments about Hamlet\u2019s notorious uncle and mother. Drawing on the twelfth- and fifteenth century sources for Hamlet, but also inventing a new history for Claudius in his far-flung travels across medieval Europe, Updike creates a vivid and surprising origin story for the fabled rottenness in Shakespeare\u2019s Denmark. The novella Rabbit Remembered (2000) is a poignant final curtain call for one of the greatest characters in twentieth-century American literature. Once again the setting is Brewer, Pennsylvania, but now Harry Angstrom\u2019s family are figuring out their lives in his absence. Harry\u2019s ghost is insistently present, and the stories shared by his children suggest that the reckoning with those closest to us, for better and for worse, never really ends. None of these books have ever been published in an annotated edition. This deluxe editions includes six rare pieces by Updike reflecting on the novels collected here."

The stories in this volume confirm Malamud as a master storyteller, from the Kafkaesque unbridled fantasy of \u201cTalking Horse\u201d to the final \u201cfictive biographies\u201d of \u201cIn Kew Gardens,\u201d about Virginia Woolf, and \u201cAlma Redeemed,\u201d about the Austrian composer Alma Mahler.

Here are two of Bradbury\u2019s most beloved collections, along with twenty-seven other stories, that together represent the best of Bradbury\u2019s stories of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s. The Illustrated Man\u2014the more Earthbound science fiction companion to Bradbury\u2019s classic collection The Martian Chronicles\u2014contains eighteen short stories bound together by the unifying metaphor of a strangely tattooed outcast. The stories explore both the dehumanizing possibilities of space-age technology\u2014in \u201cThe Veldt\u201d and \u201cThe Rocket Man\u201d--and the pessimistic, dark side of humanity, as in \u201cThe Visitor.\u201d The October Country collects nineteen short stories: macabre carnival tales, speculative horror, and strange fantasy. \u201cUncle Einar\u201d and \u201cHomecoming\u201d concern the monstrous and immortal Elliott family. In \u201cThe Next in Line,\u201d a woman becomes convinced that she\u2019ll never leave the small, Mexican town she\u2019s traveled to on vacation. And in \u201cTouched with Fire,\u201d two old men have learned to predict future murders. This edition restores the original artwork by Joe Mugnaini. Rounding out the volume are twenty-seven other short stories from the first half of Bradbury\u2019s career selected by Bradbury scholar Joanthan R, Eller, including \u201cFrost and Fire,\u201d in which humans on another planet live only eight days; \u201cThe Pedestrian,\u201d about the only man in the world who does not watch television, and \u201cI Sing the Body Electric!,\u201d in which a family purchases a robotic grandmother. Also includes such hard to find stories as \u201cR is for Rocket,\u201d \u201cAsleep in Armageddon,\u201d and \u201cThe Lost City of Mars.\u201d"

        "summary": "\"British Antifascism and the Holocaust, 1945-79 explores the extent to which the Holocaust has shaped British antifascism. The author tests assertions of an uncomplicated relationship between Holocaust memory and the imperative to resist postwar fascist revivals. For those with a scholarly interest in how antifascists confront their opponents, it is essential to understand whether the Holocaust has always been seen as an insurmountable barrier against fascism: is the idea of the genocide's constant antifascist 'use' actually a dangerous assumption and, if so, what are the implications of this for 'Antifa' as its battle with the contemporary far right unfolds? This book provides a political and structural history of the Holocaust's relationship to antifascist organisations and questions whether networks of solidarity formed around Holocaust memory, including analysing the impact of the genocide in Jewish antifascists' motivations and rhetoric. It also assesses the Holocaust's political capital in wider antifascism and connected anti-racism, including in defence of the Black and Asian communities increasingly victimised by fascists over the postwar period. This book will appeal to scholars and students with interests in antifascism, fascism, racism, and Jewish and left-wing history in Britain, and how these intersect with Holocaust consciousness\"--"

        "summary": "Based on the auto-ethnographic work of a team of scholars who developed the first major Black Digital Humanities program at a research institution, this book details how to centralize Black feminist praxes of care, ethics, and Black studies in the digital humanities with Radical Intentionality. In this important and timely collection, the authors Catherine Knight Steele, Jessica H. Lu, and Kevin C. Winstead - the first team of the African American Digital Humanities Initiative - center Black scholars, Black thought, and Black studies in creating digital research and programming. Providing insight into acquiring funding, building and maintaining community, developing curricula, and establishing a national network in the field, this book moves Black persons and Black thought from the margins to the center with a set of best practices and guiding questions for scholars, students, and practitioners developing programming, creating work agreements, building radically intentional pedagogy and establishing an ethical future for Black digital humanities. This is essential reading for researchers, students, scholars, and practitioners working in the fields of digital humanities and Black studies, as well as graduate students, faculty, and administrators working in humanities disciplines who are interested in forming centers, courses, and/or research programs in Black digital studies."

        "summary": "Imagine spending a day with top analytical leaders and asking any question you want. In this book, Wayne Eckerson illustrates analytical best practices by weaving his perspective with commentary from seven directors of analytics who unveil their secrets of success. With an innovative flair, Eckerson tackles a complex subject with clarity and insight. Each of the book's 20 chapters is a stand-alone essay on an analytical topic, yet collectively they form a concise methodology about how to implement a successful analytics program. From the Foreword by Michael Halbherr, Executive Vice President, Nokia We are living in a time of radical change. From my vantage point as head of Nokia's Location and Commerce business, I see many business and technical trends shaping our future--and all depend on a new commodity: data. In our mapping business, I see the need to evolve from a road-centric tool to something that allows people to truly understand and maneuver the complexities of a modern city. To accomplish this, we need a lot of data and ways to correlate disparate information into what we call \"Smart Data.\" Analytics is core to what we do, and how we deliver value to customers today and in the future. I recently spoke to the Nokia board about our data, and some members questioned how we could monetize this asset. Since a few members are executives in the oil industry, I told them that data is the \"oil of the future\", and that you monetize this new resource the same way you monetize oil, by spending time and money refining it. In our case, we are refining data about people, locations, social interactions, traffic, musical preferences, and so on to bring maps to life. The analytical leaders profiled in this book demonstrate how to refine data for business gain and innovation. They play a pivotal role by bridging the worlds of business and technology. When supported by the business, they've delivered remarkable solutions that have given their organizations a competitive edge. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to monetize the most important resource of our time: data. It's written in language that both a CEO and a CIO can understand, and carries important lessons no matter what side of the business-technology aisle someone sits."

        "summary": "Never watch The Exorcist, Marlena Williams's mother told her, just as she'd been told by her own mother as a Catholic teen in rural Oregon when the horror classic premiered. And like her mother, Mary, Williams watched it anyway. An inheritance passed from mother to daughter, The Exorcist looms large--in popular culture and in Williams's own life, years after Mary's illness and death. In Night Mother, Williams investigates the film not only as a projection of Americans' worst fears in the tumultuous 1970s and a source of enduring tropes around girlhood, faith, and transgression but also as a key to understanding her mother and the world she came from. The essays in Night Mother delve beneath the surface of The Exorcist to reveal the deeper stories the film tells about faith, family, illness, anger, guilt, desire, and death. Whether tracing the career of its young star, Linda Blair, unpacking its most infamous scenes, exploring its problematic depictions of gender and race, or reflecting on the horror of growing up female in America, Williams deftly blends bold personal narrative with shrewd cultural criticism. Night Mother offers fresh insights for both fans of the film and newcomers alike."

        "summary": "There was much uncertainty about how voice related to body in the early eighteenth century, and this became a major subject of scientific and cultural interest. In Voices from Beyond, Scott Sanders provides an interdisciplinary and transnational study of eighteenth-century conceptions of the human voice. His book examines the diversity of thought about vocal materiality and its roles in philosophical and literary works from the period, uncovering representations of the voice that intertwine physiology with physics, music with moral philosophy, and literary description with performance. Voices from Beyond focuses on the voice as it was constructed in French works, influenced by French vocal sciences as well as British literary and philosophical texts. It considers the writing of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Fran\u00e7ois Baculard d'Arnaud, and Jacques Cazotte in particular, and explores how their texts theorize, represent, and construct three interrelated vocal types: the sentimental, the vitalist, and the uncanny. These authors represented the human voice as an intersectional organ with implications for one's emotional disposition, physical health, cultural identity, gender, and sexuality. Sanders argues that while the conception of sentimental and vitalist voices was anchored to a physiological understanding of vocal organs, this paradoxically led to the development of a disembodied, uncanny voice--one that could imitate the sounds of a good moral fiber while masking a monstrous physiology."

        "summary": "In Hope Draped in Black Joseph R. Winters responds to the enduring belief that America follows a constant trajectory of racial progress. Such notions\u2014like those that suggested the passage into a postracial era following Barack Obama's election\u2014gloss over the history of racial violence and oppression to create an imaginary and self-congratulatory world where painful memories are conveniently forgotten. In place of these narratives, Winters advocates for an idea of hope that is predicated on a continuous engagement with loss and melancholy. Signaling a heightened sensitivity to the suffering of others, melancholy disconcerts us and allows us to cut against dominant narratives and identities. Winters identifies a black literary and aesthetic tradition in the work of intellectuals, writers, and artists such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, and Charles Burnett that often underscores melancholy, remembrance, loss, and tragedy in ways that gesture toward such a conception of hope. Winters also draws on Walter Benjamin and Theodor Adorno to highlight how remembering and mourning the uncomfortable dimensions of American social life can provide alternate sources for hope and imagination that might lead to building a better world."

An international team of leading scholars offer accessible and thought-provoking essays that present an expansive global vision of the archipelago's history from c. 1868 to the twenty-first century. Japan was the first non-Western society to become a modern nation and empire, to industrialize, and to deliver a high standard of living to virtually all its citizens, capturing international attention ever since. These Japanese efforts to reshape global hierarchies powered a variety of debates and conflicts, both at home and with people and places beyond Japan's shores. Drawing on the latest Japanese and English-language scholarship, this volume highlights Japan's distinctive and fast-changing history."

Schooling the Movement moves beyond the prevailing understanding that activism was defined solely by litigation and direct-action forms of protest. The authors in this volume broaden our conceptions of what it meant to actively take part in or contribute to the civil rights movement."

The idea of luxury has secured a place in contemporary Western culture and the term has now joined common parlance in both established and emerging economies. Crafting Luxury explores contentious issues surrounding perceptions of luxury, its relationship to contemporary branding as created by marketers, and the effect this has on consumers and their purchasing habits. It examines the industry structures, analyzing production practices as well as the effects of hierarchies on both internal and external perceptions of luxury, from the makers to the sellers and consumers. Offering different perspectives and interpretations of luxury, the authors dissect the work of companies across the industry, from established companies to emerging models and from conglomerates to small independents. They further explore the impact of technology on consumption, manufacture, the retail environment, and sales, providing a true insider's view of this complex world."

Written just after the war ended, in the early days of the emerging Cold War, the novel daringly engages with the authoritarian impulses in the American character. To celebrate and commemorate the centennial of Mailer\u2019s birth and the 75th anniversary of the publication of his unforgettable debut novel, this expanded collector\u2019s edition includes a selection of 23 letters (all but four from Mailer to his first wife, Beatrice) chosen by Mailer biographer J. Michael Lennon that reveals the keen insight and powerful ambition of a brilliant young writer grappling with the challenge of converting the weight of experience into art."

Le Guin Ursula K. Le Guin\u2019s career began and ended with poetry. This sixth volume in the definitive Library of America edition of her works gathers, for the first time, her collected poems\u2014from her earliest collection Wild Angels (1974) through her final publication, the collection So Far So Good, which she delivered to her editor just a week before her death in 2018. The themes explored in the poems gathered here resonate through all Le Guin\u2019s oeuvre, but find their strongest voice in her poetry: exploration as a metaphor for both human bravery and creativity, the mystery and fragility of nature and the impact of humankind on their environment, the Tao Te Ching, marriage, womanhood, and even cats. Le Guin\u2019s poetry is often traditional in form but never in style: her verse is earthy, surprising, and lyrical. Including some 40 poems never before collected, this volume restores to print much of Le Guin's remarkable verse. It features a new introduction by editor Harold Bloom, written before his death in 2019, in which he reflects on the power of Le Guin\u2019s poems, which he calls \u201cAmerican originals.\u201d It also features helpful explanatory notes and a chronology of Le Guin\u2019s life."

Scott Fitzgerald features the author\u2019s acknowledged masterpiece and most popular book, The Great Gatsby. It was Gatsby that solidified his reputation as the chronicler of the Jazz Age and established him as one of the leading American novelists of his generation. Perhaps no other novel of the twentieth century makes a greater claim to being our Great American Novel\u2014for its poetic prose, its exploration of the broad, intertwined themes of money, class, and American optimism (Daisy Buchanan\u2019s voice is \u201cfull of money\u201d), its dominance of high school and college curricula, and its claims upon the public imagination. The novel is presented in a newly edited text, correcting numerous errors and restoring Fitzgerald\u2019s preferred American spellings. Also included in this volume are Fitzgerald\u2019s third collection of stories, All the Sad Young Men, which includes some of the author\u2019s best short fiction\u2014\"Winter Dreams,\u201d \u201cThe Rich Boy,\u201d and \u201cAbsolution\u201d\u2014as well as a generous selection of stories and nonfiction from the period 1920\u20131926, all in newly corrected texts."

        "summary": "The Seventh Edition of this foundational text represents the most comprehensive source available for connecting multiple and diverse theories to literacy research, broadly defined, and features both cutting-edge and classic contributions from top scholars. Two decades into the 21st century, the Seventh Edition finds itself at a crossroads and differs from its predecessors in three major ways: the more encompassing term literacy replaces reading in the title to reflect sweeping changes in how readers and writers communicate in a digital era; the focus is on conceptual essays rather than a mix of essays and research reports in earlier volumes; and most notably, contemporary literacy models and processes enhance and extend earlier theories of reading and writing. Providing a tapestry of models and theories that have informed literacy research and instruction over the years, this volume's strong historical grounding serves as a springboard from which new perspectives are presented. The chapters in this volume have been selected to inspire the interrogation of literacy theory and to foster its further evolution. This edition is a landmark volume in which dynamic, dialogic, and generative relations of power speak directly to the present generation of literacy theorists and researchers without losing the historical contexts that preceded them. Some additional archival essays from previous editions are available on the book's eResource. New to the Seventh Edition: Features chapters on emerging and contemporary theories that connect directly to issues of power and contrasts new models against more established counterparts. New chapters reflect sweeping changes in how readers and writers communicate in a digital era. Slimmer volume is complemented by some chapters from previous editions available online."

In a field of evolving literacy practices, this volume builds off the three pillars of transnational writing education--translingualism, transculturalism, and cosmopolitanism--and offers both conceptual and practice-based support for scholars, students, and educators in order to address current issues of inclusion, multilingual learning, and diversity."

Presenting a series of methodological dialogues between eminent education researchers including Michael Apple, Gert Biesta, Penny Enslin, John Hattie, Nel Noddings, Michael Peters, Richard Pring and Paul Smeyers, this book explores the ways in which they have chosen and developed research methods to style their investigations and frame their arguments. These dialogues address the specialized and technical aspects of conducting educational research, conceptualize the relationship between methodology and theory, and provide in-depth discussion of concerns including falsifiability, openness, interpretation and researcher judgement. Foregrounding the researchers' first-hand experience and knowledge, this book will provide future and current researchers with a deeper comprehension of the place of theory in education research. An illuminating resource for undergraduate and postgraduate researchers alike, Theory and Philosophy in Education Researchconfronts the intricate complexities of conducting education research in a highly engaging and accessible way."

This multi-authored volume discusses core issues within family systems theory, including anxiety, stress, emotional cutoff, differentiation of self, multigenerational transmission process, and nuclear family emotional process. Chapters also examine related constructs in the research literature such as adaptation, resilience, social support, social networks, and intergenerational family relations. Readers will be able to view theoretical and methodological issues from the perspective of Bowen theory and develop a clearer knowledge of ways to navigate the challenges faced when studying individual, familial, and societal problems. An essential resource for clinicians and researchers in the social and natural sciences, the Handbook of Bowen Family Systems Theory and Research Methods provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the application of Bowen theory to family practice and family research."

I was especially out of place because I had never visited Minnesota, the land of 10,000 lakes and 100,000 fishermen. #2 I learned that water in Southern Florida is especially contaminated with birth control hormones. I also learned that reclaimed water is all around me in Florida, and that lawns use it. #3 The water issue is actually very simple. While living organisms like bacteria and parasites are successfully filtered out or killed by high chemical levels, the smallest molecules, especially the hormones, are not removed from drinking water. #4 Part 1: Indecent Exposures begins with a simple definition of the term estrogenic, and then lists the top 10 estrogenic substances found in our environment. Part 2: Rising Disease focuses on common elements that all estrogenic substances share, and how these elements can cause health problems."

        "summary": "The 2008 financial crisis--like the Great Depression--was a world-historical event. What caused it will be debated for years, if not generations. The conventional narrative is that the financial crisis was caused by Wall Street greed and insufficient regulation of the financial system. That narrative produced the Dodd-Frank Act, the most comprehensive financial-system regulation since the New Deal. There is evidence, however, that the Dodd-Frank Act has slowed the recovery from the recession. If insufficient regulation caused the financial crisis, then the Dodd-Frank Act will never be modified or repealed; proponents will argue that doing so will cause another crisis. A competing narrative about what caused the financial crisis has received little attention. This view, which is accepted by almost all Republicans in Congress and most conservatives, contends that the crisis was caused by government housing policies. This book extensively documents this view. For example, it shows that in June 2008, before the crisis, 58 percent of all US mortgages were subprime or other low-quality mortgages. Of these, 76 percent were on the books of government agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. When these mortgages defaulted in 2007 and 2008, they drove down housing prices and weakened banks and other mortgage holders, causing the crisis. After this book is published, no one will be able to claim that the financial crisis was caused by insufficient regulation, or defend Dodd-Frank, without coming to terms with the data this book contains."

        "summary": "This thought-provoking volume offers comprehensive analysis of contemporary research and literature on student evaluation of teaching (SET) in Higher Education. In evaluating data from fields including education, psychology, engineering, science, and business, this volume critically engages with the assumption that SET is a reliable and valid measure of effective teaching. Clayson navigates a range of cultural, social, and era-related factors including gender, grades, personality, student honesty, and halo effects to consider how these may impact on the accuracy and impartiality of student evaluations. Ultimately, he posits a \"popularity hypothesis\", asserting that above all, SET measures instructor likability. While controversial, the hypothesis powerfully and persuasively draws on extensive and divergent literature to offer new and salient insights regarding the growing and potentially misleading phenomenon of SET. This topical and transdisciplinary book will be of great interest to researchers, faculty, and administrators in the fields of higher education management, administration, teaching and learning."

Technology creates opportunities to learn differently and presents challenges for education. Virtual Reality solutions can be exciting, create interest in learning, make learning more accessible, and make learning faster. This book analyzes the capabilities of Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality by providing ideas on how to make learning more effective, how existing VR/AR solutions can be used as learning tools, and how a learning process can be structured. The VR solutions can be used successfully for educational purposes as their use can contribute to the construction of knowledge and the development of metacognitive processes. They also contribute to inclusive education by providing access to knowledge that would not otherwise be available. This book will be of great interest to academics, researchers, and post-graduate students in the field of educational technology."

Not many contemporary readers will know, for example, the compelling arguments the second century AD Greek philosopher Porphyry makes for vegetarianism, long before a plant-based diet began to garner headlines. Plutarch's serio-comic exposition of the rationality and inherent dignity of non-human creatures-put on the lips of one of Circe's pigs-is so fresh that it sounds like it was formulated just yesterday. The knowledge the poet Theognis derived from Greek sponge divers about the behavior of octopods rivals our contemporary fascination with the octopus. Aristotle's introduction to the scientific study of animal morphology and behavior remains unparalleled for its elegance and insight, and it represents one of the first forays into natural history writing. Seneca, employing an ingenious etymological pun on the word animal, endeavors to show that we humans are morally inferior to our animal cousins, who instinctively know and are satisfied with their place in Nature. The Greeks and Romans, amidst all their magnificent cultural achievements and reckless, destructive behavior, lived closer than most of us to the perils and prospects of their environments. This afforded them a sensitivity to their environments and, in particular, to their fellow creatures that can perhaps help to disabuse us of our disconnectedness from animal life. This small volume demonstrates how astoundingly relevant the ancients still are in this regard\"--"

        "summary": "Resegregation as Curriculum offers a compelling look at the formation and implementation of school resegregation as contemporary education policy, as well as its impact on the meaning of schooling for students subject to such policies. Working from a ten-year study of a school district undergoing a process of resegregation, Rosiek and Winslow examine the ways this \"new racial segregation\" is rationalized and the psychological and sociological effects it has on the children of all races in that community. Drawing on critical race theory, agential realism, and contemporary pragmatist semiotics, the authors expose how these events functioned as a hidden curriculum that has profound repercussions on the students' identity formation, self-worth, conceptions of citizenship, and social hope. This important account of racial stratification of educational opportunity expands our understanding of the negative consequences of racial segregation in schools and serves as a critical resource for academics, educators, and experts who are concerned about the effects of resegregation nationwide."

At the same time, it advances meaningful perspectives on the scholarship and history that originally shaped the field. Divided into five major sections--basic domains, context, technology, methodology and assessment, and individual and group differences--this thoroughly updated handbook addresses recent theoretical refinements and advances in instruction and intervention that have changed approaches to developing learners' capabilities to self-regulate in educational settings. Chapters written by leading experts in the field include discussions of methodological advances and expansions into new technologies and the role of learner differences in such areas as contexts and cultures. As a comprehensive guide to a rapidly evolving and increasingly influential subject area, this volume represents contemporary and future thinking in self-regulation theory, research, and applications. Chapter Structure - To ensure uniformity and coherence across chapters, each chapter author addresses the theoretical ideas underlying their topic, research evidence bearing on these ideas, future research directions, and implications for educational practice. Global - A significant number of international contributors are included to reflect the increasingly international research on self-regulation. Readable - In order to make the book accessible to students, chapters have been carefully edited for clarity, conciseness, and organizational consistency. Expertise - All chapters are written by leading researchers who are highly regarded experts on their particular topics and are active contributors to the field."

        "summary": "This collection of humanist readings of Simone de Beauvoir's work is a novel contribution to contemporary research on Beauvoir, and a defense of the importance of the humanities. It demonstrates the significance and value of humanistic research through the work of Beauvoir, and argues that the reception and influence of her works demonstrate the transformative potential of humanistic research. Organized around three topics, each chapter ascertains Beauvoir's relation to the humanities and the humanist tradition. The first group focuses on Beauvoir's interdisciplinary methodology and critical thinking, the second on her ethics of freedom and the construction of values. The last section explores how Beauvoir uses literature as a laboratory for developing her ideas on human interaction. The chapters can be studied as independent essays, or read together as a whole. Simone de Beauvoir: A Humanist Thinker reveals new and previously unexplored dimensions of Beauvoir's work by exposing her as a significant and inspiring humanist thinker. This volume attests that Beauvoir's works continue to offer conceptual tools and insights enabling readers to critically analyze their own situation. In today's world, where religious fanaticism and totalitarian ideologies are gaining ground, humanist values and humanistic research are more important than ever. -- From publisher's website."

        "summary": "Systems Theories for Psychotherapists explores three key theories that underpin many of the models of psychotherapy: general systems theory, natural systems theory, and language systems theory. The book presents the aesthetics (how to see and understand what is happening) and the pragmatics (what to do in the therapy room) behind each theory. It also explores how therapists can successfully conceptualize the problems that clients bring to therapy, offering a range of contemporary examples to show how each theory can be applied to practice. Starting with an introduction to systems theories, the book then delves into cybernetics, interactional systems, natural systems, constructivist theory, and social construction theory. Each chapter uses a distinctive case example to help clinicians to better understand and apply the theories to their own therapeutic setting. Woven throughout the book are three helpful learning tools: \"Applying Your Knowledge,\" \"Key Figure,\" and \"Questions for Reflection,\" providing the reader with the opportunity to critically engage with each concept, consider how their own world view and preconceptions can inform their work with clients, and challenging them to apply prominent systems theories to their own practice. Systems Theories for Psychotherapists is a clear and valuable text for undergraduate and graduate students in mental health programs, including counseling, marriage and family therapy, social work and clinical psychology, as well as for all practicing clinicians."

        "summary": "\"The movement away from teacher-centred toward student-centred learning and teaching (SCLT) in higher education has intensified in recent decades. Yet, in spite of its widespread use in literature and policy documents, SCLT remains somewhat poorly defined, under-researched and often misinterpreted. Against this backdrop, The Routledge Handbook of Student-Centred Learning and Teaching in Higher Education offers an original, comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the fundamentals of SCLT and its discussion and applications in policy and practice. Bringing together 70 scholars from around the world, the volume provides examples of good practice that display how instructional expertise manifests itself, and critically discusses challenges, new directions and developments in pedagogy, course and study program design, and classroom practice and assessment. Including reviews of theoretical, conceptual, methodological issues and case study examples, each chapter also considers implications for implementing SCLT across various contexts in higher education. An essential resource, this book uniquely offers researchers, educators and students in higher education new\"--"

While placing Brazil within the abolitionist political mobilization of the nineteenth century, the book explores the relationships between Brazilian and foreign abolitionists, demonstrating how ideas and strategies transcended borders. Available for the first time in an English-language edition, with a new introduction, this award-winning volume is a major contribution to the scholarship on abolition and abolitionists\"--"

Grounded by a national study on student activism and the authors' combined 40 years of experience working in higher education, Identity-Based Student Activism uses a critical, power-conscious lens to unpack the history of identity-based activism, relationships between activists and administrators, and student activism as labor. This book provides an opportunity for administrators, educators, faculty, and student activists to reflect on their current ideas and behaviors around activism and consider new ways for improving their relationships with each other, and ultimately, their campus climates."

        "summary": "Clinical Psychology, Third Edition offers an introduction to clinical psychology as it is operating on the ground - delivering clinical interventions, supervision, consultation, leadership, training and research, in rapidly changing health and care services. This new edition of Clinical Psychology brings together practitioners, researchers, and people who have used the services of clinical psychologists to explain how clinical psychologists work, the evidence that their work is based on, and how it can change peoples' lives for the better. The book explains the core principles of clinical practice, as well as outlining the role of a clinical psychologist within a healthcare team. It covers issues involved in working with children and families, adult mental health problems, people with disabilities and physical health issues, and the use of neuropsychology. In this fully revised third edition, every chapter has been brought up to date with developments in research and practice, and chapters have been added regarding the important fields of working with autistic people and working with people in forensic mental health services. Given the popularity of clinical psychology for many undergraduate and graduate students, the contents of this text have been designed around teaching and learning features that can be used as the basis for an intermediate or advanced-level course that will allow students to learn both breadth and depth about clinical psychology."

        "summary": "A look at how post-9/11 cinema captures the new face of war in the twenty-first century While the war film has carved out a prominent space within the history of cinema, the twenty-first century has seen a significant shift in the characteristics that define it. Serving as a roadmap to the genre's contemporary modes of expression, The New American War Film explores how, in the wake of 9/11, both the nature of military conflict and the symbolic frameworks that surround it have been dramatically reshaped. Featuring in-depth analyses of contemporary films like The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty, Eye in the Sky, American Sniper, and others, The New American War Film details the genre's turn away from previously foundational themes of heroic sacrifice and national glory, instead emphasizing the procedural violence of advanced military technologies and the haptic damage inflicted on individual bodies. Unfolding amid an atmosphere of profound anxiety and disillusionment, the new face of the American war film demonstrates a breakdown of the prevailing cultural narratives that had come to characterize conflict in the previous century. With each chapter highlighting a different facet of war's cinematic representation, The New American War Film charts society's shifting attitudes toward violent conflict and what is broadly considered to be its acceptable repercussions. Drawing attention to changes in gender dynamics and the focus on war's lasting psychological effects within these recent films, Robert Burgoyne demonstrates how cinema both reflects and reveals the makeup of the national imaginary."

This volume examines the current state of Indigenous language revitalization in the Americas. Focusing on the Americas, home to 15 percent of the world\u2019s Indigenous population, it explores past and recent language revitalization research and initiatives across this vast territory, including \"top-down\" (official) and \"bottom-up\" (grassroots) language planning and policy. The book is organized thematically and regionally, with complementary chapters representing work in Canada, the U.S., and the circumpolar North, and in Latin America and the Caribbean. Offering state-of-the-art scholarship and analysis of practice in Indigenous language revitalization throughout the hemisphere, this singular collection, with chapters by both established and emerging scholars \u2013 Indigenous and non-Indigenous, all with strong expertise in their topic \u2013 is an invaluable resource to widen the research horizon and deepen regional and cross-regional perspectives on language revitalization for Indigenous peoples."

        "summary": "A legendary Cuban-American storyteller enters the Library of America series with a volume gathering three seductive and profound novels about family, desire, music, and loss Oscar Hijuelos (1951\u20132013) is one of the most acclaimed Latino writers of the last half century. Here are three classic novels that opened a window on the Cuban-American experience, announcing a major new voice in our literature. Hijuelos launched his career with Our House in the Last World (1983), a resonant and nuanced novel portraying one immigrant\u2019s family story in midcentury Manhattan. At its center is Hector Santino, whose family has left the \u201chome province of Fidel Castro, Batista, and Desi Arnaz\u201d to settle in New York City, where their ebullient expectations of the good life in America lead, inevitably, to myriad disappointments and adjustments. In his best-known novel, The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love (1989)\u2014a book that Gabriel Garcia Marquez said he would have liked to have written\u2014Hijuelos offers an unforgettable tribute to Latin music and its place in American culture around the middle of the twentieth century. Earning Hijuelos the Pulitzer Prize, the first to be awarded a Latino novelist, The Mambo Kings is also about the fleeting nature of fame and celebrity as well as the more profound themes of love, desire, and family. The poignant Mr. Ives\u2019 Christmas (1995), which Hijuelos once noted was an attempt to write a Christmas story \u201cwithout being corny,\u201d takes up themes of loss and redemption in a story that poses the age-old question of why bad things happen to good people. This Library of America edition marks the entrance of Hijuelos into the series with a deluxe hardcover edition that includes as well a newly researched chronology of the author\u2019s life."

        "summary": "A definitive edition of a modern master: three essential works that reveal his incomparable style, dark humor, and uncanny sensitivity to the complexities of \"living in dangerous times\" Includes White Noise, now a major motion picture starring Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig This first volume in the Library of America Don DeLillo edition presents three indispensable novels from the 1980s, published here with new prefaces from the author. The Names (1982) was DeLillo's breakthrough novel, a book that, as he reflects here, spanned a \u201cbroader expanse\u201d than his earlier novels. James Axton, a \u201crisk analyst\u201d tasked with assessing dangers for his corporate clients from terrorism and other forms of political upheaval, uncovers evidence of ritual murders committed by a cult obsessed with ancient languages. The investigations of these crimes yields a profound series of meditations on identity, disconnection, and the nature of language itself. Part campus satire, part midlife character study, and part fever dream of a hyperreality that has become uncannily familiar, the National Book Award\u2013winning White Noise (1985) creates a terrifying yet wickedly funny portrait of a postmodern America that is still recognizably ours, a world where children chant brand names in their sleep, university professors \u201cread nothing but cereal boxes,\u201d and \u201cyou are the sum of your data.\u201d Three years in the research and writing, Libra (1988) offers a magnificent counter-history of the JFK assassination and a nuanced portrait of the president\u2019s murderer. DeLillo has observed that \u201cthe novel, working within history, is also outside it, correcting, clearing up, finding balances and rhythms.\u201d The result is a revelatory new depiction of a defining event in twentieth-century history. Rounding out the volume are two hard-to-find essays directly related to the novels: \u201cAmerican Blood,\u201d the 1983 Rolling Stone article that was DeLillo\u2019s first effort to grapple with the JFK assassination and the welter of information and speculation the events of the killing and Oswald\u2019s own murder by Jack Ruby; and \u201cSilhouette City,\u201d an assessment of extremist right-wing groups and the troubling presence of neo-Nazism in the United States."

        "summary": "In Pursuit of Healthy Environments brings temporal depth to a highly topical issue, the interaction between health and the environment. By means of a rich set of historical case studies from Americas to Europe and from the tropics to the Arctic, the volume demonstrates that the concern for creating and finding healthy environments is not a new one, shows how the link between the environment and health has been perceived at different times and in different cultures, and discusses the practical implications of these conceptualizations. The book written by scholars from architecture, cultural anthropology, history, Indigenous Studies, media studies and sociology will be of interest to a reader interested in the historical roots of present health-related environmental issues. It discusses the spatiality and materiality of the conceptions of health and the practices of nurture in colonial and post-colonial environments and shows how greatly indigenous and colonial mindsets have differed during the last 300 years. It also investigates how certain environments have become labelled as healthy and life-preserving while others stigmatized by death and disease and how fluctuating these notions can be. Finally, it analyses the materialities and immaterialities, as well as the transgenerational and transboundary characters of environmental and medical knowledge."

        "summary": "For more than forty years Jan Gehl has helped to transform urban environments around the world based on his research into the ways people actually use\u2014or could use\u2014the spaces where they live and work. In this revolutionary book, Gehl presents his latest work creating (or recreating) cityscapes on a human scale. He clearly explains the methods and tools he uses to reconfigure unworkable cityscapes into the landscapes he believes they should be: cities for people. Taking into account changing demographics and changing lifestyles, Gehl emphasizes four human issues that he sees as essential to successful city planning. He explains how to develop cities that are Lively, Safe, Sustainable, and Healthy. Focusing on these issues leads Gehl to think of even the largest city on a very small scale. For Gehl, the urban landscape must be considered through the five human senses and experienced at the speed of walking rather than at the speed of riding in a car or bus or train. This small-scale view, he argues, is too frequently neglected in contemporary projects. In a final chapter, Gehl makes a plea for city planning on a human scale in the fast- growing cities of developing countries. A \u201cToolbox,\u201d presenting key principles, overviews of methods, and keyword lists, concludes the book. The book is extensively illustrated with over 700 photos and drawings of examples from Gehl\u2019s work around the globe."

        "summary": "The historic Welsh origins of the architect's creative defiance. The father of modern architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright learned his defiant creativity from the radical politics and work ethic of his Welsh family. Throughout his career, Wright strongly resisted the idea that his accomplishments owed anything to earthly influences. As much as he wanted his achievements recognized, he wanted them to be unaccountable, but according to Jonathan Adams, they are not. Drawing on new discoveries about the architect's upbringing, this book reveals how Wright's mother and many aunts and uncles raised him with a reverence for the fierce radicalism of their Welsh ancestors. Presenting a new perspective on a renowned creative, Jonathan Adams reveals how the culture, faith, and philosophy of Wales shaped Wright into the visionary he became."

        "summary": "The Politics of Memory in the Italian Populist Radical Right examines the role of colonial memory in the contemporary Italian populist radical right, which includes the Lega and Fratelli d'Italia (FdI). The book originally adopts postcolonialism as an analytical framework to critically examine which roles colonial memory plays in the Italian populist radical right. Considering the timeframe between 2013 and 2021, this book suggests that the contemporary Italian populist radical right selectively shaped its memory of the colonial past, expunging the most difficult aspects from it. The fact that the Italian populist radical right parties examined do not fully acknowledge the controversial aspects of Italy's colonial past, which are bracketed off discourse, may contribute to the deployment of colonial discourse by these same parties when discussing immigration. From this Italian case study, broader implications can be drawn regarding the role of colonial memory in political discourse, which is a topical matter across Europe. The book will be of interest to those studying populism, the radical right, Italian politics and history, colonialism, and the politics of memory."

Indeed, as the eminently readable judge and legal scholar Richard Posner shows, we make quite rational choices about sex, based on the costs and benefits perceived. Drawing on the fields of biology, law, history, religion, and economics, this sweeping study examines societies from ancient Greece to today\u2019s Sweden and issues from masturbation, incest taboos, date rape, and gay marriage to Baby M. The first comprehensive approach to sexuality and its social controls, Posner\u2019s rational choice theory surprises, explains, predicts, and totally absorbs."

        "summary": "Building on the foundational The Affect Theory Reader, this new volume gathers together contemporary scholarship that highlights and interrogates the contemporary state of affect inquiry. Unsettling what might be too readily taken-for-granted assumptions in affect theory, The Affect Theory Reader 2 extends and challenges how contemporary theories of affect intersect with a wide range of topics and fields that include Black studies, queer and trans theory, Indigenous cosmologies, feminist cultural analysis, psychoanalysis, and media ecologies. It foregrounds vital touchpoints for contemporary studies of affect, from the visceral elements of climate emergency and the sensorial sinews of networked media to the minor feelings entangled with listening, looking, thinking, writing, and teaching otherwise. Tracing affect's resonances with today's most critical debates, The Affect Theory Reader 2 will reorient and disorient readers to the past, present, and future potentials of affect theory.

        "summary": "In The Right to Look, Nicholas Mirzoeff develops a comparative decolonial framework for visual culture studies, the field that he helped to create and shape. Casting modernity as an ongoing contest between visuality and countervisuality, or \u201cthe right to look,\u201d he explains how visuality sutures authority to power and renders the association natural. An early-nineteenth-century concept, meaning the visualization of history, visuality has been central to the legitimization of Western hegemony. Mirzoeff identifies three \u201ccomplexes of visuality\u201d\u2014plantation slavery, imperialism, and the present-day military-industrial complex\u2014and explains how, within each, power is made to seem self-evident through techniques of classification, separation, and aestheticization. At the same time, he shows how each complex of visuality has been countered\u2014by the enslaved, the colonized, and opponents of war, all of whom assert autonomy from authority by claiming the right to look. Encompassing the Caribbean plantation and the Haitian revolution, anticolonialism in the South Pacific, antifascism in Italy and Algeria, and the contemporary global counterinsurgency, The Right to Look is a work of astonishing geographic, temporal, and conceptual reach."

        "summary": "Poems of revolution by one of Latin America\u2019s most beloved poets One of Latin America\u2019s greatest poets, Roque Dalton was a revolutionary whose politics were inseparable from his art. Born in El Salvador in 1935, Dalton dedicated his life to fighting for social justice, while writing fierce, tender poems about his country and its people. In Stories and Poems of a Class Struggle, he explores oppression and resistance through the lens of five poetic personas, each with their own distinct voice. These poems show a country caught in the crosshairs of American imperialism, where the few rule the many and the many struggle to survive\u2014and yet there is joy and even humor to be found here, as well as an abiding faith in humanity. In striking, immediate, exuberantly inventive language, Dalton captures the ethos of a people, as stirring now as when the book was first published forty years ago. \u201cI believe the world is beautiful,\u201d he writes, \u201cand that poetry, like bread, is for everyone.\u201d"

        "summary": "Celebrates the life and legacy of Bayard Rustin, the civil rights leader behind the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and FreedomWhile we can all recall images of Martin Luther King Jr. giving his \"I Have a Dream\" speech in front of a massive crowd at Lincoln Memorial, few of us remember the man who organized this watershed nonviolent protest in eight short weeks: Bayard Rustin. This was far from Rustin's first foray into the fight for civil rights. As a world-traveling pacifist, he brought Gandhi's protest techniques to the forefront of US civil rights demonstrations, helped build the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led the fight for economic justice, and played a deeply influential role in the life of Dr. King by helping to mold him into an international symbol of nonviolent resistance. Rustin's legacy touches many areas of contemporary life--from civil resistance to violent uprisings, democracy to socialism, and criminal justice reform to war resistance. Despite these achievements, Rustin was often relegated to the background. He was silenced, threatened, arrested, beaten, imprisoned, and fired from important leadership positions, largely because he was an openly gay man in a fiercely homophobic era. With expansive, searching, and sometimes critical essays from a range of esteemed writers--including Rustin's own partner, Walter Naegle--this volume draws a full picture of Bayard Rustin: a gay, pacifist, socialist political radical who changed the course of US history and set a precedent for future civil rights activism, from LGBTQ+ Pride to Black Lives Matter."

Any mature legal system must contain a body of law addressing what we owe in the way of obligations to respect each other's physical and psychological integrity, property, privacy, freedom of action, reputation, and so on. If people were free to injure and interfere with one another in any way that they wished, we would still be in a state of nature. Yet if the law of torts is fundamental, it is also elusive. One hundred and fifty years ago, Oliver Wendell Holmes opined that tort law was not \"a proper subject for a law book.\" Holmes soon changed his mind, but to this day, leading torts scholars assert that the law of torts is so fundamentally fragmented that the only adequate way to describe the field is to say that it encompasses some civil wrongs that do not arise out of contract. This book argues that the law of torts is a fundamental legal institution because it establishes an essential form of justice among persons. Tort is about what it is that we owe to each other in the way of reciprocal responsibilities not to interfere with, or impair, essential interests that we possess simply because we are persons. Tort law's rhetoric of reasonableness thus reveals its fundamental moral commitment. Tort law seeks to impose responsibilities not to impair or interfere with each other's urgent interests on terms that are justifiable both to those protected, and to those burdened, by its terms\"--"

        "summary": "Palestinians are often asked to provide their own vision for peace. But how can a colonized people be expected to put forward a plan for peace when their colonizers are curtailing their options and denying any just possibilities out of hand? When in actuality their synonym for peace is submission?Typically, Palestinians have been expected to squeeze their resistance and their political and historical discourses into the small spaces permitted by outside agendas. What is needed is a truly Palestinian vision for how best to pursue their struggle, particularly now in a post-Oslo context.Our Vision for Liberation: Engaged Palestinian Leaders & Intellectuals Speak Out aims to challenge several strata of the current Palestine discourse that have led to the present dead end: the American pro-Israel political discourse, the Israeli colonial discourse, the Arab discourse of purported normalization, and the defunct discourse of the Palestinian factions. None promote justice, none have brought resolution; none bode well for any of the parties involved.Here, an alternative Palestinian view of liberation and decolonization is provided by engaged Palestinian leaders and intellectuals, those who been actively involved in generating an ongoing Palestinian discourse on liberation, taking into account the parameters of their struggle as it now stands. Drawing on their own personal experiences as educators, community leaders, spiritual leaders, artists, historians, human rights activists, political prisoners, and the like, they address what now, what next, is to be done, in a manner that reflects not only Palestinian aspirations, but their view of what is possible. 'Liberation' is a term that was dropped from the official Palestinian lexicon simply because it was incompatible with the US-championed political discourse, but it has resurfaced here because without its justice dimensions, there can be no peace. Now that the international community is able to see that Oslo, along with the 'two-state solution' model, has irreversibly failed, the paradigmatic void has opened space for the articulation of new possibilities. Our Vision for Liberation embraces this opportunity to introduce a new Palestinian discourse, one that is able to address current challenges and obstacles to Palestinian rights and freedom, and provide diverse paths, all leading forward."

This edited volume is inspired by, and applies, decolonial and feminist thought - two fields with powerful traditions of critical pedagogy, which have shared productive exchange. The structure of this collection reflects the synergies between decolonial and feminist thought in its four parts, which offer reflections on the politics of knowledge; the challenging pathways of finding your voice; the constraints and possibilities of institutional contexts; and the relation between decolonial and feminist thought and established academic disciplines. To root this book in the political struggles that inspire it, and to maintain the close connection between political action and reflection in praxis, chapters are interspersed with manifestos formulated by activists from across the world, as further resources for learning and teaching. These essays definitively argue that the decolonization of universities, through the re-examination of how knowledge is produced and taught, is only strengthened when connected to feminist and critical queer and gender perspectives. Concurrently, they make the compelling case that gender and feminist teaching can be enhanced and developed when open to its own decolonization."

        "summary": "If you work with children, you must have this book. For more than two decades, Pediatric Injectable Drugs (The Teddy Bear Book) has served an important and continuing need for reliable evidence-based information specific to pediatric injectable drugs, including all drugs commonly used in the treatment of infants and children from neonates to adolescents, with age-specific dosing and administration guidelines throughout. ASHP's classic reference on pediatric drugs is now fully revised with the eleventh edition of Pediatric Injectable Drugs. Included in this edition are 15 new monographs, with 241 monographs in total. Each monograph now includes a new category on obesity dosing. All information is compiled in an evidence-based manner from the primary literature, including case reports, observational reports, and comparative trials. As with previous editions, the structure of each of the drug monographs covers the following areas: Brand names. Medication error potential. - Contraindications and warnings. Infusion-related cautions. Age-specific dosage. Dosage adjustment in organ dysfunction. Maximum dosage. Additives. Suitable diluents. Maximum concentrations. Preparation and delivery. IV push. Intermittent infusion. Continuous infusion. Other routes of administration. Comments. When it comes to pediatric injectable drugs, valid safety and efficacy research can be hard to locate: this indispensable reference changes all that."

        "summary": "\"This book considers how vulnerability theory provides the basis for a reconceptualization of the liberal ideas of autonomy, equality, and freedom. Vulnerability theory argues a 'vulnerable legal subject' should displace the 'liberal legal subject' that currently dominates law and policy. The theory is based on the fundamental empirical realities of the material body and offers an alternative to a social contract or rights-based notion of state responsibility, both of which tend to privilege abstractions such as rationality or dignity. A vulnerability analysis poses law and policy questions based on the \"vulnerable legal subject\" and requires new thinking about state or governmental responsibility. Importantly, to achieve a truly comprehensive and inclusive notion of what constitutes social justice or a universal or 'common' good, vulnerability theory mandates a reassessment of both equality and freedom as these concepts are currently conceived. Presenting the work of scholars from a wide-range of doctrinal areas, it is this task that the book takes up. In particular, in recognizing that many social or institutional relationships entail uneven positions of dependence and reliance, it maintains that individualized notions of equality or freedom are inadequate and must be reformulated to include a sense of collective or social justice, incorporating asymmetric or unequal allocations of responsibility and requiring appropriate limitations on the individual. This book's reorientation of the subject, as well as the central objectives of law and policy will appeal to scholars and students in law, vulnerability studies, gender studies, critical legal and political theory, politics, philosophy, and sociology\"--"

        "summary": "Winner of the 2012-2013 Asian/Pacific American Librarian's Association Book Award Winner of the 2013 American Sociological Association's Asia and Asian America Section Distinguished Book Award The first half of the twentieth century witnessed a wave of Filipino immigration to the United States, following in the footsteps of earlier Chinese and Japanese immigrants, the first and second \u201cAsiatic invasions.\u201d Perceived as alien because of their Asian ethnicity yet legally defined as American nationals granted more rights than other immigrants, Filipino American national identity was built upon the shifting sands of contradiction, ambiguity, and hostility. Rick Baldoz explores the complex relationship between Filipinos and the U.S. by looking at the politics of immigration, race, and citizenship on both sides of the Philippine-American divide: internationally through an examination of American imperial ascendancy and domestically through an exploration of the social formation of Filipino communities in the United States. He reveals how American practices of racial exclusion repeatedly collided with the imperatives of U.S. overseas expansion. A unique portrait of the Filipino American experience, The Third Asiatic Invasion links the Filipino experience to that of Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, Chinese and Native Americans, among others, revealing how the politics of exclusion played out over time against different population groups. Weaving together an impressive range of materials\u2014including newspapers, government reports, legal documents and archival sources\u2014into a seamless narrative, Baldoz illustrates how the quixotic status of Filipinos played a significant role in transforming the politics of race, immigration and nationality in the United States."

Edited by curator Howie Chen, the book gathers archival material from the group's wide-ranging activities, which included producing exhibitions and forums to social change advocacy surrounding institutional racism, the politics of representation, Western imperialism, the AIDS crisis and violence against Asian Americans. Godzilla created a social space for diasporic Asian artists and art professionals, including members Tomie Arai, Karin Higa, Byron Kim, Paul Pfeiffer, Eugenie Tsai, Lynne Yamamoto and Alice Yang, among others. Founded by artists Ken Chu, Bing Lee and Margo Machida in New York and eventually expanding into a national network, Godzilla's aim was to \"function as a support group interested in social change through art, bringing together art and advocacy\" and \"to contribute to changing the limited ways Asian Pacific Americans participate and are represented in broad social context--in the artworld and beyond.\" This comprehensive chronicle of Godzilla: Asian American Arts Networkassembles art projects, critical writing, correspondences, exhibition and meeting documentation, media clippings and other archival ephemera to convey the political and cultural stakes of the time."

Part 1 focuses on strategies for turning courtroom stories into \u201cargument-centered narratives\u201d that emphasize the evidence that supports legal claims. Part 2 analyzes and illustrates strategies, techniques and rules for presenting argument-centered narratives effectively during all phases of trial, from opening statement to closing argument. Part 2 includes separate chapters devoted to strategies for expert witnesses, oral persuasion skills, and courtroom technology. The book includes two chapters that approach the Federal Rules of Evidence as guides for admissibility of evidence rather than as exclusionary obstacles. They explain and illustrate how to satisfy the foundational requirements for virtually all forms of oral and tangible evidence, including electronic exhibits and exhibits prepared by forensic graphics experts. The chapters also explain effective strategies for making and responding to objections. The book uses real and fictional trial settings from different eras and sources to add variety while analyzing rhetorical trial strategies and emphasizing their durability. For example, the chapter on closing argument compares arguments made in the murder trial of Euphiletus (Greece, circa 400 B.C.) with those made in the trial of OJ Simpson (1995). Other analyses are based on the trials of the Rosenbergs (the so-called \u201catomic spies,\u201d 1953) and the Menendez brothers (1991), while still other illustrative examples are based on the Hillmon case (1892), and the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire trial (1911). We also illustrate and analyze trial strategies in the context of classic courtroom films such as Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird, 12 Angry Men and My Cousin Vinny, and even children\u2019s stories such as Humpty Dumpty and Jack & Jill.\" -- Publisher."

        "summary": "Adopting the latest agile tools and practices won\u2019t be enough to respond to rapid market change. Leaders must first lay the groundwork by creating the right environment for these tools to work. Many managers struggle to install the underlying organizational operating system for business agility. High-performing agile organizations depend on the strength of six key enabling factors: leadership, culture, structure, people, governance, and ways of working. This book explains why these factors are important and how they work together to increase organizational agility. Real-world examples, stories, and tools will help leaders get realistic about the scope of changes needed in their organizations and show them how to get started. Karim Harbott does not offer a book of recipes. Instead, he focuses on mindset, principles, and general patterns. This book summarizes of the most important factors in increasing organizational agility and why they work, which leaders will need to consider in a so-called agile transformation. Because every organization is different, each will have its own route to agility and high performance. Managers will need to tackle all the areas that are crucial to creating an environment in which any chosen approach can work."

        "summary": "A landmark visual exploration of nature printing, featuring 45 different techniques and hundreds of astonishing rare images. Hailed as the earliest precursor to photography, nature printing is the practice of using impressions from the surface of a natural object such as leaves, flowering plants, ferns, seaweed, snakes, and more to produce an image. Author Matthew Zucker has spent decades curating the most extensive collection of nature prints ever assembled, with more than 13,000 images across 120 rare and seminal works, including journals, published books, unique manuscripts, American currency, and instructional texts related to nature printing from 1733 to 1902. This gorgeous volume explores Zucker's collection, allowing readers to see these nature prints presented side by side for the first time and enabling unique comparisons while creating a visually stunning journey through the developments over a 150-year period in printing methods, including photography with examples of cyanotypes. The ultimate guide to nature printing, this is a beautiful reference work for scholars, artists, designers, botanists, and anyone interested in nature, botanical illustration, and printing. BASED ON AN UNPRECEDENTED PRINT COLLECTION: This book's stunning visuals are selections from the most extensive collection of nature prints ever assembled, comprised of more than 13,000 images.

        "summary": "\"Czeslaw Milosz (1911-2004) was one of the great literary voices of the twentieth century, in no small part because he very much lived the events and ideologies of that century. Born into a Polish family in what was then the western fringe of the Russian Empire, and what is now Lithuania, a young man Milosz found his life upended by the First World War and his father's conscription in the Russian army. In the Second World War, he provided aid to Jews in Warsaw as a partisan and a member of the Polish socialist underground. But after the war he lived as a permanent exile, from Poland, from Soviet communism, from his early fervent Catholicism and then, later, even from the almost garish extremes and inequalities of the American society in which he chose to live. His work is a lasting legacy. His poetry remains in print, whether in Polish or English or the other languages into which it has been translated, and his two classic works of prose non-fiction, The Captive Mind, his reflection on the hypnotic effect of ideology, and Native Realm, his memoir on his life in Poland and his life away from it, have been reissued in Penguin Classics. He won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980. In this new volume of the Writers on Writers series, writer Eva Hoffman draws on her conversations with Milosz during their encounters and her own private engagement with his work, in order to comprehend someone whose intellectual and geographic trajectory serves as a mirror to her own, as someone who emigrated with her family from her native Poland and who has since lived and pursued a literary career in the anglophone world. Hoffman concentrates on several important themes in Milosz's life and work, such as his resistance to dogma and fanaticism, his fascination with place and geographic separation, his awareness of his own exile, his attraction to all life, his capacity for pleasure, and finally his basic humanism, which underpinned his poetry\"--"

        "summary": "Jacqueline Kahanoff: A Levantine Woman is the first intellectual biography of this remarkable Egyptian-Jewish intellectual, whose work has secured her place in literary pantheon as a herald of Levantine, Mediterranean, and transnational culture. Growing up Jewish in cosmopolitan Egypt in the 1920s and 1930s, Jacqueline Kahanoff experienced a bustling Middle East enriched by diverse languages, religions, and peoples who nonetheless were deeply connected to each other through history, business, daily practices, and shared landscape. At the age of twenty-four, Kahanoff immigrated to the United States. Her stories, essays, and short autobiographical novel attest to her penchant to cross boundaries, generations, social classes, sexes, and Western and Eastern constructs. After immigrating to Israel in the early 1950s, she critically addressed the country's \"provinciality\" and \"ethnic nationalism\" as seen through her conception of a transnational Levantine culture. Through many writings, Kahanoff set forth her distinctive vision of Israel as a Mediterranean country with a broad, multicultural Levantine identity. Drawing on an extensive array of sources, ranging from interviews with Jacqueline Kahanoff's acquaintances and contemporaries to unpublished writings, David Ohana explores her fascinating life and intellectual journey from Cairo to Tel Aviv. The encompassing vision of a Levantine Israel made Kahanoff the initiator of a different cultural possibility, more extensive than that offered in her time, and also, perhaps, than is offered today."

        "summary": "Successful corporate strategies, says this leading professor of management, depend upon dynamic marshaling of a firm's \u201cinvisible assets\u201d\u2014information-based resources such as technological know-how, the visibility of a brand name, or knowledge of a customer base\u2014as well as tangible assets such as people, goods, and money. Hiroyuki Itami emphasizes the ways strategy must fit the firm's external environment (customers, competitors, and ever-changing technology) and also the importance of internal fit within the organization. He uses invisible assets as a single organizing concept to discuss the appropriateness of strategy in each area. Strategy, Itami insists, must be adapted to rapidly changing conditions and must sometimes be prepared in advance of expected change. The most powerful strategy may often intentionally create imbalance in the short run in order to accumulate invisible assets and energize the organization. Itami examines successful strategies of Japanese firms, which have always operated in an environment of uncertainty and all-pervasive change. Sony and Honda are not the only examples, however\u2014Itami also discusses IBM, Volkswagen, and the Swiss watch industry. The range of examples gives the book wide applicability and appeal to American business executives, who are now facing a similar situation of rapid change. The clarity and sound construction of Itami's argument will make it useful not only to MBAs and theorists of international business and comparative management, but also to \u201creal world\u201d planners and managers who are currently coping with just the sort of situations Itami describes."

Clifford Ando gave valuable recommendations about sources for the ancient world, and Daniela Cammack kindly provided drafts of her now-published article about Athenian juries. Trial lawyer Bobby Burchfield generously gave detailed and deeply knowledgeable comments on the manuscript. Karen Wahl provided expert assistance locating sources. I thank Morgan Reinhardt for allowing me to use her research on jury forepersons, and Anna Offit, her law professor, for guiding me to her and for comparative work on juries. Anna Caraveli and Jonathan Chaves, my colleague at George Washington University, made important suggestions and pointed out places in which non-lawyers needed further explanation of legal concepts. My daughter Anna Lerner provided the perspective of a younger reader and gently let her mother know where improvements would be helpful. For decades, John Langbein has been a constant source of insight about juries.

        "summary": "Scholars have traditionally viewed the Italian Renaissance artist as a gifted, but poorly educated craftsman whose complex and demanding works were created with the assistance of a more educated advisor. These assumptions are, in part, based on research that has focused primarily on the artist's social rank and workshop training. In this volume, Angela Dressen explores the range of educational opportunities that were available to the Italian Renaissance artist. Considering artistic formation within the history of education, Dressen focuses on the training of highly skilled, average artists, revealing a general level of learning that was much more substantial than has been assumed. She emphasizes the role of mediators who had a particular interest in augmenting artists' knowledge, and highlights how artists used Latin and vernacular texts to gain additional knowledge that they avidly sought. Dressen's volume brings new insights into a topic at the intersection of early modern intellectual, educational, and art history."

        "summary": "This book highlights the significant role played by Ignatius Sancho (c. 1729-80), the first black man to vote in England, in the British abolitionist movement. Examining the letters of Sancho, and especially his correspondence with the influential novelist and preacher, Laurence Sterne, the author analyses the relationship between sensibility and antislavery in eighteenth-century Britain. The book demonstrates how Sancho navigated the bawdy, riotous conditions of commercial London, which was the headquarters of a growing and war-torn Empire. It shows how Sancho mastered the fashionable and gendered language of the culture of sensibility, navigating the contemporary issues of race, slavery, and politics. The book also touches on the White metropolitan and colonial preoccupation with Black men\u2019s sexuality, which was intensified by the Somerset decision of 1772. Sancho\u2019s was a unique and influential voice in eighteenth-century Britain, making this book an insightful read for scholars of anti-slavery as well as gender, race and imperialism in British history."

        "summary": "A compelling portrait of Mary Wollstonecraft that shows the intimate connections between her life and work Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, first published in 1792, is a work of enduring relevance in women's rights advocacy. However, as Sylvana Tomaselli shows, a full understanding of Wollstonecraft\u2019s thought is possible only through a more comprehensive appreciation of Wollstonecraft herself, as a philosopher and moralist who deftly tackled major social and political issues and the arguments of such figures as Edmund Burke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Adam Smith. Reading Wollstonecraft through the lens of the politics and culture of her own time, this book restores her to her rightful place as a major eighteenth-century thinker, reminding us why her work still resonates today. The book\u2019s format echoes one that Wollstonecraft favored in Thoughts on the Education of Daughters: short essays paired with concise headings. Under titles such as \u201cPainting,\u201d \u201cMusic,\u201d \u201cMemory,\u201d \u201cProperty and Appearance,\u201d and \u201cRank and Luxury,\u201d Tomaselli explores not only what Wollstonecraft enjoyed and valued, but also her views on society, knowledge and the mind, human nature, and the problem of evil\u2014and how a society based on mutual respect could fight it. The resulting picture of Wollstonecraft reveals her as a particularly engaging author and an eloquent participant in enduring social and political concerns. Drawing us into Wollstonecraft\u2019s approach to the human condition and the debates of her day, Wollstonecraft ultimately invites us to consider timeless issues with her, so that we can become better attuned to the world as she saw it then, and as we might wish to see it now."

        "summary": "In this incisive account, scholar Horace Campbell investigates the political and economic crises of the early twenty-first century through the prism of NATO\u2019s intervention in Libya. He traces the origins of the conflict, situates it in the broader context of the Arab Spring uprisings, and explains the expanded role of a post-Cold War NATO. This military organization, he argues, is the instrument through which the capitalist class of North America and Europe seeks to impose its political will on the rest of the world, however warped by the increasingly outmoded neoliberal form of capitalism. The intervention in Libya\u2014characterized by bombing campaigns, military information operations, third party countries, and private contractors\u2014exemplifies this new model. Campbell points out that while political elites in the West were quick to celebrate the intervention in Libya as a success, the NATO campaign caused many civilian deaths and destroyed the nation\u2019s infrastructure. Furthermore, the instability it unleashed in the forms of militias and terrorist groups have only begun to be reckoned with, as the United States learned when its embassy was attacked and personnel, including the ambassador, were killed. Campbell\u2019s lucid study is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand this complex and weighty course of events."

        "summary": "This book provides an introduction to food policy in the United Kingdom, examining policy development, implementation, influences and current issues. The book begins by providing a wide-ranging introduction to food policy in the UK, situating it within wider global debates and establishing key drivers, such as issues related to global citizenship, trade and finance. The use of food control as a policy lever is also discussed and contrasted with alternative approaches based on behaviour change. The book presents an overview of the history of UK food policy, from which there is much to be learned, before moving onto current challenges posed by political instability, both at home and abroad, global pandemics and cost of living crises. Foremost is the need to manage public health, including both malnutrition and obesity, while promoting sustainable and healthy diets, as well as the broader issues around addressing food security and food poverty. The book also examines public sector food initiatives, such as school food and early childhood provisions, and food regulation. As a part of food regulation, chapters examine food scares and food fraud, from chalk in flour to \"horsegate\". The role of media, marketing and advertising is also considered within a policy perspective. Taking a wider lens, the book also discusses the impact of global food trade and the financialisation of food on food policy in the UK and vice versa. The book is supported by instructor eResources on the Routledge website designed to support student learning as well as provide regular updates on UK food policy developments. The eResources include student activities, group exercises and links to further reading and additional resources. This book serves as a key introduction to UK food and agricultural policy for students, scholars, policymakers and professionals, as well as those interested in food systems, public health and social policy more widely."

        "summary": "\"From the bestselling author of The Shakespeare Wars and Explaining Hitler comes a stirring manifesto on love in the modern age. From one generation to the next, our understanding of love is constantly evolving, be it courtship, sex, or romantic relationships. The science of love is advancing, too, from the study of chemicals responsible for our behavior in love to the mining of data generated using dating apps. Now, more than ever, we find ourselves asking: what is love? Is it a diffuse feeling or a quantifiable chemical reaction? What is lust? What is a chance meeting and what is fate? And why have we become so obsessed with codifying love through science? Ron Rosenbaum interrogates love's role in the public imagination over centuries to uncover its age old-and newer-secrets. Rosenbaum's research pulls from centuries of the arts and sciences as well as his own lived experience, illuminating the loves that have marked his life and the sacrifices he has made for each. He argues for the beauty and specialness of love, and for its capacity to make us kinder, wiser, and more generous. He shows us the feeling of breath being taken away and the skipping of a heartbeat. In essence, he argues for the very capacity that makes us human. A Defense of Love is more than a primer on the intersection of love with literature and science-it is a guide to a deeply noble pursuit: the power of surrendering to love\"--"

        "summary": "\"A riveting work about the woman who sacrificed her future for one of the most famous writers of the twentieth century and a probing look at what it means to be a wife and a writer in the modern world. Looking for wonder and some reprieve from the everyday, award-winning writer Anna Funder slips into the pages of her hero George Orwell. As she watches him create his writing self, she tries to remember her own. When she uncovers his forgotten wife, it's a revelation. Eileen O'Shaughnessy's literary brilliance shaped Orwell's work and her practical common sense saved his life. But why-and how-was she written out of the story? Using newly discovered letters from Eileen to her best friend, Funder recreates the Orwells' marriage, through the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War in London. As she rolls up the screen concealing Orwell's private life she is led to question what it takes to be a writer-and what it is to be a wife. Genre-bending and utterly original, Wifedom is an ode to the unsung work of women everywhere today, while offering a breathtakingly intimate view of one of the most important literary marriages of the twentieth century. It is a book that speaks to our present moment as much as it illuminates the past\"--"

        "summary": "On April 29, 1946, the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, also known as the IMTFE, the Tokyo Tribunal or the Tokyo Trials, began. This unique trial lasted for over 21\u20442 years, with judges from 11 nations and only 28 defendants, all of whom were found guilty of various crimes against humanity and crimes against the peace. Both of these phrases were first used in this and its European counterpart, the International Military Tribunal. Though over the course of time other tribunals have become more well known, the Tokyo Tribunal was pivotal in the establishment of this means of international justice. This book is intended to bring the research of this trial up to date. In this book, Jim Mumm has sought to look at all of the literature since 2000 that focuses in whole or in part on this unique Japanese trial. The book will include a timeline that includes background events which were influential in establishing both the IMT and the IMTFE, as well as information on source documents from the era of the trials and literature that has not been included in previous bibliographies. While not intending to replicate other bibliographies, it will also point to major works from the 20th century.--Publisher."

Amid eerie injuries, changing bodies, amputated limbs, and untimely deaths, many people across the Caribbean and Central America simply call the affliction \u201csugar\u201d\u2014or, as some say in Belize, \u201ctraveling with sugar.\u201d A decade in the making, this book unfolds as a series of cr\u00f3nicas\u2014a word meaning both slow-moving story and slow-moving disease. It profiles the careful work of those \u201cstill fighting it\u201d as they grapple with unequal material infrastructures and unsettling dilemmas. Facing a new incarnation of blood sugar, these individuals speak back to science and policy misrecognitions that have prematurely cast their lost limbs and deaths as normal. Their families\u2019 arts of maintenance and repair illuminate ongoing struggles to survive and remake larger systems of food, land, technology, and medicine."

Applying contemporary research understandings of what leads to positive child outcomes and safer communities, Child First challenges traditional risk-led and stigmatising approaches to working with children in trouble. It has now been adopted as the four-point guiding principle for all policy and practice across the youth justice system in England and Wales, it is becoming a key reform principle for youth justice in Northern Ireland, and it is increasingly influential across several western jurisdictions. With contributions from academics, policymakers and practitioners, this book critically charts the progress and challenges in establishing a progressive evidence-led youth justice system. Its dynamic and accessible integration of theory, research, policy and practice, alongside discussion of critical themes, makes it a key read for students on youth crime/justice modules and for a wider market. Stephen Case is Professor of Youth Justice in the Criminology, Sociology and Social Policy division at Loughborough University, UK. Neal Hazel is Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice in the School of Health and Society at the University of Salford, UK."

A surge in interest in black reparations is taking place in America on a scale not seen since the Reconstruction Era. The Black Reparations Project gathers an accomplished interdisciplinary team of scholars\u2014members of the Reparations Planning Committee\u2014who have considered the issues pertinent to making reparations happen. This book will be an essential resource in the national conversation going forward. The first section of The Black Reparations Project crystallizes the rationale for reparations, cataloguing centuries of racial repression, discrimination, violence, mass incarceration, and the immense black-white wealth gap. Drawing on the contributors\u2019 expertise in economics, history, law, public policy, public health, and education, the second section unfurls direct guidance for building and implementing a reparations program, including draft legislation that addresses how the program should be financed and how claimants can be identified and compensated. Rigorous and comprehensive, The Black Reparations Project will motivate, guide, and speed the final leg of the journey for justice."

To answer this question, \"Black Health\" dispels any notion that Black people have inferior bodies that are inherently susceptible to disease. This is simply false racial science that has been used to abuse Black people since our African ancestors were brought to America on slave ships. A genuine investigation into the status of Black people's health requires us to acknowledge that race has always been a powerful social category. Race largely predetermines individuals' social and political power and access to resources needed for health and wellbeing. And as a group, Black people have been intentionally denied this power and access. Systemic racism, oppression, and White supremacy in American institutions have largely been the perpetrators of differing social power and access to resources for Black people. It is these systemic inequities that create the social conditions needed for poor health outcomes for Black people to persist. An examination of social inequities reveal that is no accident that Black people have poorer health than White people, instead in America, almost every institution has been designed to withhold what Black people need for proper health and wellbeing. \"Black Health\" provides a succinct discussion of Black people's health, including the social, political, and at times cultural determinants of their health. This book examines the ways that Black people's multiple identities-social, cultural, and political-intersect with anti-Black institutions, such as housing and health care to determine their poor outcomes in pregnancy, pain management, sleep, and cardiovascular disease\"--"

        "summary": "\"Legislating under the Charter explores how governments and Parliament justify limitations on rights when advancing laws that raise rights concerns or when responding to judicial decisions under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Through an analysis of legislation concerning criminal justice policy, the approval of new safe consumption sites, sex work, and medical aid in dying, the book provides a detailed analysis of the extent and nature of parliamentary deliberation about rights, the extent to which government initiatives are properly scrutinized, and the broader institutional relationships under the Charter. The authors draw from a host of qualitative data, including research interviews and examination of judicial decisions, various bills under study, Hansard debates from the floor of the House of Commons, committee and Senate scrutiny of legislation, bureaucratic advice and Charter statements by the department of justice, and news media coverage. The book offers a set of concrete reform proposals to improve the transparency and accountability of executive and bureaucratic vetting processes, and to strengthen the role of Parliament in upholding constitutional values and holding the government to account. In doing so, Legislating under the Charter contributes to the broader comparative scholarship on models of judicial review, morality policy, policy change, and constitutionalism.\"--"

        "summary": "This book examines how those with disabilities, and in particular, the Deaf and hard-of-hearing, are impacted by the influence language and culture in policing, criminal law, and corrections. Frequently left out of policy making and research, almost no resources exist that can inform and aid law enforcement, legal, and correctional officials on culturally competent interactions with the Deaf and hard-of-hearing. As a result, this group is at a distinct disadvantage when dealing with law enforcement or the courts as well as being vastly underserved, which often lead to negative outcomes for the Deaf suspect/defendant/inmate as they attempt to interact with law enforcement and navigate the legal system. In a step-by-step presentation from arrest to incarceration each chapter will discuss a specific part of the legal system. As well as providing information on the topic, this book can serve as an important resource to the myriad of issues and difficulties that may be experiences by the Deaf suspect, defendant, or inmate, as well as by law enforcement officers, attorneys, and correctional officers. To illustrate these issues, previous cases of Deaf suspects, defendants, and inmates will be presented and discussed to clarify key issues and to provide a perspective of the problem. Each chapter dealing with these issues will also provide suggestions for more culturally competent interactions between the Deaf community and the legal system."

        "summary": "Known as the \"swing justice,\" Justice Anthony M. Kennedy provided the key vote determining which way the Supreme Court would decide on some of the most controversial cases in US history. Though criticized for his unpredictable rulings, Kennedy also gained a reputation for his opinion writing and, more so, for his legal rhetoric. This book examines Justice Kennedy's legacy through the lenses of rhetoric, linguistics, and constitutional law. Essays analyze Kennedy's opinion writing in landmark cases such as Romer v. Evans, Obergefell v. Hodges, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Using the Justice's rhetoric as an entry point into his legal philosophy, this volume reveals Kennedy as a justice with contradictions and blind spots--especially on race, women's rights, and immigration--but also as a man of empathy deeply committed to American citizenship. A sophisticated assessment of Justice Kennedy's jurisprudence, this book provides new insight into Kennedy's legacy on the Court and into the role that rhetoric plays in judging and in communicating judgment. In addition to the editors, the contributors to this volume are Ashutosh Bhagwat, Elizabeth C. Britt, Martin Camper, Michael Gagarin, James A. Gardner, Eugene Garver, Leslie Gielow Jacobs, Sean Patrick O'Rourke, Susan E. Provenzano, Clarke Rountree, Leticia M. Saucedo, Darien Shanske, Kathryn Stanchi, and Rebecca E. Zietlow."

This book disputes this approach and highlights how reciprocity is instead linked to the structural characteristic of sovereign equality of States in international law. This book carries out an in-depth analysis of the concept of reciprocity and the elements that characterise it, before examining the various roles and articulations of reciprocity in a number of fields of public international law: the law of treaties, the treatment of individuals, the execution of international law, and the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals. In all these areas, it analyses both more traditional and more contemporary examples to demonstrate how reciprocity is closely linked to the very structure of public international law. Arianna Whelan is currently the Third Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs of Ireland. She holds a Masters and PhD in international law from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland\"--"

This descriptive foundation, revealed through the application of well-accepted theories of rights, has simply yet to be either acknowledged as, or relied upon, for rights-building. The book then moves from the descriptive task of showing where a right to health already exists in our legal corpus to the prescriptive goal of showing how we could feasibly and meaningfully expand the right through ordinary policies that are widely used in other domains, including impact assessments and state-sponsored reinsurance. By normalizing American health rights discourse and bringing a right to health, including a right to health care, within the domain of ordinary policy debate, this book arms health advocates for the sharp political contests over health that we face today\"--"

This book brings together different perspectives under two titles, considering the lives and experiences of two friends, one Vietnamese American and one white. Looking And Seeing is a poetic work of yearning, regret, and righteous indignation. In Truong Tran's poetry, what is said and what is written reveal our complexities. Composed as an investigation of his own being and body as a brown person moving through white spaces, this collection moves alongside Tran's friend and collaborator Damon Potter. Seeing and Looking offers a record of Potter's perspective as a white man examining who he is and wants to be and the complications of trying to be good while also benefiting from histories of oppression. Potter considers death--both his own future death and the deaths of his friends--while grappling with how to witness horrors, wonders, and his self."

Various means of exchange and convergence are explored through two main catalysts: humans--their trips or resettlements--and objects--such as books, paintings, sculptures, and prints. The visual and textual evidence of the transmission of ideas, iconographies and styles are examined, such as triumphal ephemera, treatises on painting, the social status of the artist, collections and their display, church decoration, and funerary monuments, providing a more nuanced understanding of the exchanges of styles, forms and ideals across southern Europe."

The book will serve as a reference for practicing environmental engineers, regulators, toxicologist, researchers, and concerned members of the public."

        "summary": "Across more than fifty original essays, Keywords for Comics Studies provides a rich, interdisciplinary vocabulary for comics and sequential art. The essays also identify new avenues of research into one of the most popular and diverse visual media of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.0Keywords for Comics Studies presents an array of inventive analyses of terms central to the study of comics and sequential art that are traditionally siloed in distinct lexicons: these include creative and aesthetic terms like Ink, Creator, Border, and Panel; conceptual terms such as Trans*, Disability, Universe, and Fantasy; genre terms like Zine, Pornography, Superhero, and Manga; and canonical terms like X-Men, Archie, Watchmen, and Love and Rockets.0This volume ties each specific comic studies keyword to the larger context of the term within the humanities. Essays demonstrate how scholars, cultural critics, and comics artists from a range of fields take up sequential art as both an object of analysis and a medium for developing new theories about embodiment, identity, literacy, audience reception, genre, cultural politics, and more. Keywords for Comics Studies revivifies the fantasy and magic of reading comics in its kaleidoscopic view of the field's most compelling and imaginative ideas."

        "summary": "This book provides a theoretical framework for empirically examining the impact of violence on marginalized peoples across the lifespan. With anti-Black racism uniquely impacting Black women and girls who are sexually victimized, a unifying, empirically testable framework with a critical race perspective to examine Black women and girls' experiences of sexual violence is warranted. Dr. Jennifer M. G\u00f3mez created cultural betrayal trauma theory (CBTT) to expand the limiting assumption in the dominant theoretical and methodological literature on the impact of violence that traumas, such as rape, are solely interpersonal. In CBTT, Dr. G\u00f3mez builds on Black feminist scholarship, ethnic minority trauma psychology, and betrayal trauma theory to provide a theoretical framework for examining the impact of violence on marginalized peoples across the lifespan. The Cultural Betrayal of Black Women and Girls is the first book to use the CBTT research to contribute to academic and national discussions regarding anti-Black racism and sexual violence. Using CBTT as a foundation, this book incorporates four literatures--structural intersectionality, sexual violence against Black women and girls, cultural competency in clinical and extra-therapeutic intervention, and institutional change-- into a single resource for understanding and addressing sexual violence on individual, institutional, and societal levels."

        "summary": "Slavery helped finance the Industrial Revolution in England. Plantation owners, shipbuilders, and merchants connected with the slave trade accumulated vast fortunes that established banks and heavy industry in Europe and expanded the reach of capitalism worldwide. Eric Williams advanced these powerful ideas in Capitalism and Slavery, published in 1944. Years ahead of its time, his profound critique became the foundation for studies of imperialism and economic development. Binding an economic view of history with strong moral argument, Williams's study of the role of slavery in financing the Industrial Revolution refuted traditional ideas of economic and moral progress and firmly established the centrality of the African slave trade in European economic development. He also showed that mature industrial capitalism in turn helped destroy the slave system. Establishing the exploitation of commercial capitalism and its link to racial attitudes, Williams employed a historicist vision that set the tone for future studies.William A. Darity Jr.'s new foreword highlights Williams's insights for a new generation of readers, and Colin Palmer's introduction assesses the lasting impact of Williams's groundbreaking work and analyzes the heated scholarly debates it generated when it first appeared."

This approach considers market forces and policy goals, including economic prosperity, environmental protection, and societal well-being. The second edition has been thoroughly updated, addressing dramatic shifts in the use of fuel and electricity, accelerated plans for the use of renewable energy, and pathways towards a lower-carbon future. A new chapter on electric vehicles examines its impact on transportation, the electricity market, and carbon emissions. Global examples throughout the book reflect the universal application of energy economics. With this economic foundation, coupled with perspectives from real-world applications, and perspectives from related disciplines, this text sharpens the student's ability to understand, evaluate, and critique energy policy. A companion website provides reinforcement for students through multiple choice self-test quizzes and homework exercises, as well as additional materials for instructors. This textbook should be essential reading for students of energy economics, environmental and natural resource economics, energy-related disciplines, and general readers seeking to expand their knowledge of energy economics and policy."

        "summary": "Is environmental degradation an inevitable result of economic development? Can ecosystems be restored once government officials and the public are committed to doing so? These questions are at the heart of An Ecological History of Modern China, a comprehensive account of China's transformation since the founding of the People's Republic from the perspective not of the economy but of the biophysical world. Examples throughout illustrate how agricultural, industrial, and urban development have affected the resilience of China's ecosystems--their ability to withstand disturbances and additional growth--and what this means for the country's future. Drawing on decades of research, Stevan Harrell demonstrates the local and global impacts of China's miraculous rise. In clear and accessible prose, An Ecological History of Modern China untangles the paradoxes of development and questions the possibility of a future that is both prosperous and sustainable. It is a critical resource for students, scholars, and general readers interested in environmental change, Chinese history, and sustainable development."

        "summary": "The Miracle Worker meets Jane Eyre in this riveting companion to the highly acclaimed Show Me a Sign by Deaf author and librarian Ann Clare LeZotte. Three years after being kidnapped and rendered a live specimen in a cruel experiment to determine the cause of her deafness, fourteen year old Mary Lambert is summoned from her home in Martha's Vineyard to the mainland to teach a younger deaf girl to communicate with sign language. She can't help but wonder, Can a child of eight with no prior language be taught? Still, weary of domestic life and struggling to write as she used to, Mary pours all her passion into the pursuit of freeing this child from the prison of her isolation. But when she arrives at the manor, Mary discovers that there is much more to the girl's story -- and the circumstances of her confinement -- than she ever could have imagined. Freeing her suddenly takes on a much greater meaning -- and risk. Stunning and heartrending, fast-paced and fiercely feminist, this searing expos of ableism and racism is a spellbinding follow-up to the groundbreaking Show Me a Sign."

The book introduces the reader to the political game of food policy in order to explain \"Red\" and \"Blue\" history with food policy. This work introduces the political context for understanding partisan food policy history: the \"business\" of farming and the \"sport\" of team politics in American government. It tells the story of Democratic and Republican support for farm and food policies, with the observation that farm and food policy is essentially a social welfare policy-a traditional party fault line. The book uses original research to present the activities of Democrat and Republican Congressional Representatives, Presidents/USDA administrators and Party Platforms\"--"

        "summary": "\"What does AI mean for your business? Read this book to find out.\" -- Hal Varian, Chief Economist, Google Artificial intelligence seems to do the impossible, magically bringing machines to life--driving cars, trading stocks, and teaching children. But facing the sea change that AI brings can be paralyzing. How should companies set strategies, governments design policies, and people plan their lives for a world so different from what we know? In the face of such uncertainty, many either cower in fear or predict an impossibly sunny future. But in Prediction Machines, three eminent economists recast the rise of AI as a drop in the cost of prediction. With this single, masterful stroke, they lift the curtain on the AI-is-magic hype and show how basic tools from economics provide clarity about the AI revolution and a basis for action by executives, policy makers, investors, and entrepreneurs. In this newly revised and expanded edition, the authors illustrate how, when AI is framed as cheap prediction, its extraordinary potential becomes clear: Prediction is at the heart of making decisions amid uncertainty. Our businesses and personal lives are riddled with such decisions. Prediction tools increase productivity--operating machines, handling documents, communicating with customers. Uncertainty constrains strategy. Better prediction creates opportunities for new business strategies to compete. Reflecting on the book's reception, the authors reset the context, describing the striking impact the book has had and how its argument and its implications are playing out in the real world. And in new material, they explain how prediction fits into decision-making processes and how foundational technologies such as quantum computing will impact business choices. Penetrating, insightful, and practical, Prediction Machines will help you navigate the changes on the horizon. The impact of AI will be profound, but the economic framework for understanding it is surprisingly simple."

        "summary": "The Unsettled Plain studies agrarian life in the Ottoman Empire to understand the making of the modern world. Over the course of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the environmental transformation of the Ottoman countryside became intertwined with migration and displacement. Muslim refugees, mountain nomads, families deported in the Armenian Genocide, and seasonal workers from all over the empire endured hardship, exile, and dispossession. Their settlement and survival defined new societies forged in the provincial spaces of the late Ottoman frontier. Through these movements, Chris Gratien reconstructs the remaking of \u00c7ukurova, a region at the historical juncture of Anatolia and Syria, and illuminates radical changes brought by the modern state, capitalism, war, and technology. Drawing on both Ottoman Turkish and Armenian sources, Gratien brings rural populations into the momentous events of the period: Ottoman reform, Mediterranean capitalism, the First World War, and Turkish nation-building. Through the ecological perspectives of everyday people in \u00c7ukurova, he charts how familiar facets of quotidian life like malaria, cotton cultivation, labor, and leisure attained modern manifestations. As the history of this pivotal region hidden on the geopolitical map reveals, the remarkable ecological transformation of late Ottoman society configured the trajectory of the contemporary societies of the Middle East."

Beginning with the ideological project of colonial film to legitimize the economic exploitation and cultural hegemony of the African continent during imperial rule to its counter-historical formation and theorization. It comprises essays by film scholars and filmmakers alike, among them Roy Armes, Med Hondo, F\u00e8rid Boughedir, Haile Gerima, Oliver Barlet, Teshome Gabriel, and David Murphy, including three distinct dossiers: a timeline of key dates in the history of African cinema; a comprehensive chronicle and account of the contributions by African women in cinema; and a homage and overview of Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne, the \"Father\" of African cinema."

        "summary": "How GDP came to rule our lives\u2014and why it needs to change Why did the size of the U.S. economy increase by 3 percent on one day in mid-2013\u2014or Ghana's balloon by 60 percent overnight in 2010? Why did the U.K. financial industry show its fastest expansion ever at the end of 2008\u2014just as the world\u2019s financial system went into meltdown? And why was Greece\u2019s chief statistician charged with treason in 2013 for apparently doing nothing more than trying to accurately report the size of his country\u2019s economy? The answers to all these questions lie in the way we define and measure national economies around the world: Gross Domestic Product. This entertaining and informative book tells the story of GDP, making sense of a statistic that appears constantly in the news, business, and politics, and that seems to rule our lives\u2014but that hardly anyone actually understands. Diane Coyle traces the history of this artificial, abstract, complex, but exceedingly important statistic from its eighteenth- and nineteenth-century precursors through its invention in the 1940s and its postwar golden age, and then through the Great Crash up to today. The reader learns why this standard measure of the size of a country\u2019s economy was invented, how it has changed over the decades, and what its strengths and weaknesses are. The book explains why even small changes in GDP can decide elections, influence major political decisions, and determine whether countries can keep borrowing or be thrown into recession. The book ends by making the case that GDP was a good measure for the twentieth century but is increasingly inappropriate for a twenty-first-century economy driven by innovation, services, and intangible goods."

        "summary": "Known as the \"swing justice,\" Justice Anthony M. Kennedy provided the key vote determining which way the Supreme Court would decide on some of the most controversial cases in US history. Though criticized for his unpredictable rulings, Kennedy also gained a reputation for his opinion writing and, more so, for his legal rhetoric. This book examines Justice Kennedy's legacy through the lenses of rhetoric, linguistics, and constitutional law. Essays analyze Kennedy's opinion writing in landmark cases such as Romer v. Evans, Obergefell v. Hodges, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Using the Justice's rhetoric as an entry point into his legal philosophy, this volume reveals Kennedy as a justice with contradictions and blind spots--especially on race, women's rights, and immigration--but also as a man of empathy deeply committed to American citizenship. A sophisticated assessment of Justice Kennedy's jurisprudence, this book provides new insight into Kennedy's legacy on the Court and into the role that rhetoric plays in judging and in communicating judgment. In addition to the editors, the contributors to this volume are Ashutosh Bhagwat, Elizabeth C. Britt, Martin Camper, Michael Gagarin, James A. Gardner, Eugene Garver, Leslie Gielow Jacobs, Sean Patrick O'Rourke, Susan E. Provenzano, Clarke Rountree, Leticia M. Saucedo, Darien Shanske, Kathryn Stanchi, and Rebecca E. Zietlow."

        "summary": "Climate change and justice are so closely associated that many people take it for granted that a global climate treaty should--indeed, must--directly address both issues together. But, in fact, this would be a serious mistake, one that, by dooming effective international limits on greenhouse gases, would actually make the world's poor and developing nations far worse off. This is the provocative and original argument of Climate Change Justice. Eric Posner and David Weisbach strongly favor both a climate change agreement and efforts to improve economic justice. But they make a powerful case that the best--and possibly only--way to get an effective climate treaty is to exclude measures designed to redistribute wealth or address historical wrongs against underdeveloped countries. In clear language, Climate Change Justice proposes four basic principles for designing the only kind of climate treaty that will work--a forward-looking agreement that requires every country to make greenhouse--gas reductions but still makes every country better off in its own view. This kind of treaty has the best chance of actually controlling climate change and improving the welfare of people around the world."

        "summary": "A playful reflection on animals and videogames, and what each can teach us about the other Videogames conjure new worlds for those who play them, human or otherwise: they've been played by cats, orangutans, pigs, and penguins, and they let gamers experience life from the perspective of a pet dog, a predator or a prey animal, or even a pathogen. In Game, author Tom Tyler provides the first sustained consideration of videogames and animals and demonstrates how thinking about animals and games together can prompt fresh thinking about both. Game comprises thirteen short essays, each of which examines a particular videogame, franchise, aspect of gameplay, or production in which animals are featured, allowing us to reflect on conventional understandings of humans, animals, and the relationships between them. Tyler contemplates the significance of animals who insert themselves into videogames, as protagonists, opponents, and brute resources, but also as ciphers, subjects, and subversive guides to new ways of thinking. These animals encourage us to reconsider how we understand games, contesting established ideas about winning and losing, difficulty settings, accessibility, playing badly, virtuality, vitality and vulnerability, and much more. Written in a playful style, Game draws from a dizzying array of sources, from children's television, sitcoms, and regional newspapers to medieval fables, Shakespearean tragedy, and Edwardian comedy; from primatology, entomology, and hunting and fishing manuals to theological tracts and philosophical treatises. By examining videogames through the lens of animals and animality, Tyler leads us to a greater humility regarding the nature and status of the human creature, and a greater sensitivity in dealings with other animals."

        "summary": "A marvelous, moving new collection of poems, Requiem, Rwanda has its roots in 2006, when Laura Apol made her first trip to Rwanda. Apol\u2019s initial goal was to develop, in conjunction with Rwandan and American colleagues, a project using narrative writing to facilitate healing among young survivors of the 1994 genocide. During the time she spent leading workshops, Apol felt moved to write her own poems, and after the writing-for-healing project ended, she returned to Rwanda several times to continue her creative work. The legacy of the genocide\u2014on the people, on the land itself\u2014makes its presence felt in many of the poems. The poems are also accounts of Apol\u2019s relationships with and understandings of people post-genocide\u2014where their stories go, how they reenter their lives, and how a country that has been deeply wounded by its history continues on. These poems don\u2019t shy away from exploring the complications of being a white woman, a Westerner, and a witness in this setting: Apol relates her sense of compassion, privilege, horror, guilt, voyeurism, obligation, and love. This new collection is a rich testimonial to the strength of a nation and its people. The collection includes a closing essay, \"Writer as a Witness.\""

When Vasco Da Gama arrived in India in 1498, he mistook Hindus for Christians, but Jesuit missionaries soon declared war on the alleged idolatry of the Hindus. Today, Hindus and Catholics assert their own religious identities, but Hindu village gods and Catholic patron saints attract worship from members of both religious communities. Through fresh readings of early Portuguese sources and long-term ethnographic fieldwork, this study traces the history of Hindu-Catholic syncretism in Goa and reveals the complex role of religion at the intersection of colonialism and modernity."

        "summary": "Market driven healthcare is massively divisive. Opponents argue that a competition approach to medical treatment negatively impacts on quality, while advocates point to increased efficiencies. This book casts a critical eye over both positions to show that the concerns over quality are in fact real. Taking a two part approach, it unveils the fault lines along which healthcare provision and the pursuit of quality would in certain cases clash. It then shows how competition authorities can only effectively assess competition concerns when they ask the fundamental question of how the concept of healthcare quality should be defined and factored into their decisions. Drawing on UK, US and EU examples, it explores antitrust and merger cases in hospital, medical and health insurance markets to give an accurate depiction of the reality and challenges of regulating competition in healthcare provision."

Using illustrative examples from a range of jurisdictions and thematically organised chapters, this volume offers a comprehensive consideration of this question. With a systematic, accessible approach, it argues that the law and gender work to co-produce the legal subject. Cumulatively, the volume's chapters provide a systematic evaluation of the key facets of legal subject: the corporeal, the functional and the communal. Exploring aspects of the legal subject from the ways in which it is sexed and sexualised to its national and familial dimensions, this volume develops a complete account of the various processes through which legal orders produce gendered subjects. Across its chapters, each theoretically ambitious in its own right, this volume outlines how the law not only acts on the social world, but genders it\"--"

Texas. While most scholars and activists recognize the Lawrence decision to be the foundation for all subsequent gains for gay and lesbian equality in the twenty-first century, Phelps argues that the earlier legal challenges laid the necessary groundwork for the modern movement for queer civil rights. By probing the fascinating human stories behind these cases, this book offers a rare glimpse into an important component in the movement for gay and lesbian equality and constitutional reform in the United States. The main contribution of the book is to challenge the widely held assumption that the Lawrence v. Texas decision came out of nowhere in 2003. In reality, over several decades grassroots activists had been busy building the organizational groundwork and legal strategies necessary for this final victory over archaic sodomy laws in the United States. In the process, these activists played significant roles in creating and shaping our modern gay and lesbian rights movement\"--"

        "summary": "\"If you ask most people what influences health, almost invariably the first reply will be health care-the services that individuals receive from physicians, nurses, and other medical professionals to treat or prevent illness, also called medical care. Many people, in fact, presume the role of health care (medical care) in affecting health to be so predominant that they often use the terms health and health care interchangeably. Many people would probably also cite behaviors such as diet, exercise, smoking, and use of alcohol or drugs as key influences on health. While ample evidence supports the importance of both health care and behaviors for health, a compelling body of scientific knowledge now calls for a wider and deeper set of explanations for why some of us experience good health and others do not. This body of knowledge challenges us to think beyond common assumptions about the key causes of health and illness, to ask not only \"What influences health?\" but also \"What factors shape those influences?\" i.e., \"What influences the influences?\" This knowledge tells us that, to achieve real and lasting improvements in health, we must shift the focus to identifying and addressing the root or fundamental causes(Link and Phelan 1995)-the underlying factors that set in motion other factors that may be more easily observed but play a less fundamental role in shaping health. Ethical concerns, furthermore, require us to focus not only on a population's overall or average health, but also on health equity-whether everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible, which includes whether the resources, opportunities, and conditions required for good health are distributed equitably within the population\"--"

        "summary": "\"For more than thirty years now, Cindy Sherman has been visualizing a whole gamut of role models and female identities. ... Contrary to popular belief, the famous Untitled Film Stills (1978-80) are not her earliest works, but rather those photographs she took as a student in Buffalo between 1975 and 1977. During those years, Sherman made playing with disguises her artistic concept, producing numerous previously unknown photographs that unite a striking number of theatrical elements. Using a variety of wigs, make-up, mimicry, gestures, expressions, and costumes, Sherman reveals different social identities by playing different roles. Gabriele Schor, director of the SAMMLUNG VERBUND, has performed a scholarly assessment of the conceptual beginnings of her oeuvre and is now publishing a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of her early work.\"--Publisher description."

In their introduction to the volume, the editors suggest ways in which the transatlantic paradigm offers renewed possibilities for literary study that for too long has been tied to the ideological and political requirements of the nation state. The reader is designed to provide accessible, annotated examples of theoretical frameworks that might provoke further work in the field, as well as important pieces of literary criticism that demonstrate different possibilities of comparative analysis. The book aims to represent and promote the conceptualisation of American culture within a broader framework of transatlantic activity."

Norberto Gramaccini shows that the traditional attribution to the Venetian painter Jacopo Bellini and the interpretation of the contents contingent on it have to be subjected to a revision. Based on new findings, the mastermind and financier behind the book of drawings was actually the Paduan painter Francesco Squarcione, assisted by some of his most gifted pupils including Andrea Mantegna, Jacopo Bellini's future son-in-law. The topics of the drawings--anatomy, perspective, archaeology, mythology, contemporary chronicles, and animals--were part of the teaching program of an art academy established by Squarcione, which provided crucial impulses for the status of artists in the modern era and the dissemination of the idea of academies."

        "summary": "As Hollywood shifts towards the digital era, the role of the media franchise has become more prominent. This edited collection, from a range of international scholars, argues that the franchise is now an integral element of American media culture. As such, the collection explores the production, distribution and marketing of franchises as a historical form of media-making - analysing the complex industrial practice of managing franchises across interconnected online platforms. Examining how traditional media incumbents like studios and networks have responded to the rise of new entrants from the technology sector (such as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google), the authors take a critical look at the way new and old industrial logics collide in an increasingly fragmented and consolidated mediascape."

        "summary": "Syrian Christians in Kerala, India, although a demographic minority, are not a subordinated community. They are caste-, race-, and class-privileged and have long benefited economically and socially from their privileged position. In this book, the author focuses on Syrian Christian women to illuminate larger questions of multiple oppressions, privilege and subordination, racialization, and religion and secularism in India. Drawing on oral histories, ethnographic interviews, and personal insights, the author employs an intersectional approach and US women of color feminist theory to interrogate the relationships between religious rights and women's rights in Kerala. By exploring how inequalities within groups shape very different experiences of religious and political movements, the author lays the groundwork for imagining new feminist solidarities across religions, castes, races, and classes."

        "summary": "In 1969, the campus tumult that defined the Sixties reached a flash point at the University of Illinois. Out-of-town radicals preached armed revolution. Students took to the streets and fought police and National Guardsmen. Firebombs were planted in lecture halls while explosions rocked a federal building on one side of town and a recruiting office on the other. Across the state, the powers-that-be expressed shock that such events could take place at Illinois's esteemed, conservative, flagship university\u2014how could it happen here, of all places? Positioning the events in the context of their time, Michael V. Metz delves into the lives and actions of activists at the center of the drama. A participant himself, Metz draws on interviews, archives, and newspaper records to show a movement born in demands for free speech, inspired by a movement for civil rights, and driven to the edge by a seemingly never-ending war. If the sudden burst of irrational violence baffled parents, administrators, and legislators, it seemed inevitable to students after years of official intransigence and disregard. Metz portrays campus protesters not as angry, militant extremists but as youthful citizens deeply engaged with grave moral issues, embodying the idealism, naivet\u00e9, and courage of a minority of a generation."

        "summary": "Historians have claimed that when social stability returned to Korea after a series of devastating invasions by the Japanese and Manchus around the turn of the seventeenth century, the late Choson dynasty was a period of unprecedented economic and cultural renaissance. This book questions this age-old belief by claiming that true-view landscape and genre paintings were most likely adopted to propagandize social harmony under Choson rule and to justify the status, wealth, and land grabs of the ruling class. This volume also documents the popularity and misunderstanding of art books from China and, most controversially, Korean enthusiasm for artistic programs from Edo Japan, thus challenging academic stereotypes and nationalistic tendencies in scholarship. As the first truly interdisciplinary study of Korean art, A New Middle Kingdom illuminates the reality of the late Choson society that its visual art attempted hide."

        "summary": "\"The Medea of Euripides is one of the greatest of all Greek tragedies, and arguably the one that has the most significance for us today. A barbarian woman brought to Corinth and there abandoned by her Greek husband, Medea seeks vengeance on Jason, and is willing to strike out against his new wife and family--even slaughtering the sons she has born him. From the very beginning of the play we are drawn into a world \"torn asunder by blind, disruptive forces, which affords no consolation, no compassion for suffering.\" At its center is Medea herself, a character who refuses definition: is she a hero, a witch, a psychopath, a goddess? All that can be said for certain is that she is a woman who has loved, has suffered, and will stop at nothing for vengeance. In this stunning translation, poet Charles Martin captures the rhythms of Euripides's original text through contemporary rhyme and meter that speaks directly to modern readers. An introduction by classicist and poet A. E. Stallings examines the complex and multifaceted Medea in patriarchal ancient Greece. Perfect in and out of the classroom as well as for theatrical performance, this faithful translation succeeds like no other\"--Provided by publisher."

Tracing a region-wide attention to the deep connections between music and memory in the work of Lawrence Scott, Oscar Hijuelos, Colin Channer, Daniel Maximin, and Ramabai Espinet, Njelle Hamilton tunes in to each novel\u2019s soundtrack while considering the broader listening cultures that sustain collective memory and situate Caribbean subjects in specific localities. These \u201cmusical fictions\u201d depict Caribbean people turning to calypso, bolero, reggae, gwoka, and dub to record, retrieve, and replay personal and cultural memories. Offering a fresh perspective on musical nationalism and nostalgic memory in the era of globalization, Phonographic Memories affirms the continued importance of Caribbean music in providing contemporary novelists ethical narrative models for sounding marginalized memories and voices.

Enriched by decades of classroom teaching, it is aimed explicitly at motivated students, regardless of their previous exposure to the Bible or faith commitments. This more compact version of Collins's renowned Introduction to the Hebrew Bible is combined with even more student-friendly features, including charts, maps, photographs, chapter summaries, and bibliographies for further reading. Collins proceeds through the canon of the Old Testament and the Apocrypha, judiciously presenting the current state of historical, archaeological, and literary understanding of the biblical text, and engaging the student in questions of significance and interpretation for the contemporary world. The third edition is presented in a new and engaging format with new maps and images. An index has been added to the volume for the first time."

        "summary": "The overriding aim of this groundbreaking volume\u2014whether the subject is vocal ornamentation in 19th-century opera or the collective improvisation of the Grateful Dead\u2014is to give new recognition to performance as the core of musical culture. The collection brings together renowned scholars from performance studies and musicology (including Philip Auslander, David Borgo, Daphne Brooks, Nicholas Cook, Maria Delgado, Susan Fast, Dana Gooley, Philip Gossett, Jason King, Elisabeth Le Guin, Aida Mbowa, Ingrid Monson, Roger Moseley, Richard Pettengill, Joseph Roach, and Margaret Savilonis), with the intent of sparking a productive new dialogue on music as performance. Taking It to the Bridge is on the one hand a series of in-depth studies of a broad range of performance artists and genres, and on the other a contribution to ongoing methodological developments within the study of music, with the goal of bridging the approaches of musicology and performance studies, to enable a close, interpretive listening that combines the best of each. At the same time, by juxtaposing musical genres that range from pop and soul to the classics, and from world music to games and web-mediated performances, Taking It to the Bridge provides an inventory of contrasted approaches to the study of performance and contributes to its developing centrality within music studies."

Examining how gothic has been globalised and globalisation made gothic, this collection of essays explores an emerging globalgothic that is simultaneously a continuation of the western tradition and a wholesale transformation of that tradition which expands the horizons of the gothic in diverse new and exciting ways. Globalgothic contains essays from some of the leading scholars in gothic studies as well as offering insights from new scholars in the field. The contributors consider a wide range of different media, including literary texts, film, dance, music, cyberculture, computer games, and graphic novels. This book will be essential reading for all students and academics interested in the gothic, in international literature, cinema, and cyberspace."

        "summary": "The long battle between exclusionary and inclusive versions of the American story Was America founded as a Christian nation or a secular democracy? Neither, argues Philip Gorski in American Covenant. What the founders envisioned was a prophetic republic that would weave together the ethical vision of the Hebrew prophets and the Western political heritage of civic republicanism. In this eye-opening book, Gorski shows why this civil religious tradition is now in peril\u2014and with it the American experiment. American Covenant traces the history of prophetic republicanism from the Puritan era to today, providing insightful portraits of figures ranging from John Winthrop and W.E.B. Du Bois to Jerry Falwell, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama. Featuring a new preface by the author, this incisive book demonstrates how half a century of culture war has drowned out the quieter voices of the vital center, and demonstrates that if we are to rebuild that center, we must recover the civil religious tradition on which the republic was founded."

        "summary": "Nationalism has become a key area of political theory over recent years, with a huge expansion in the amount of literature available. Yet there are very few Readers which bring together the best and most representative of these works in one volume. This Reader includes both the core texts in the area which are required for any course on nationalism, and a selection of more interesting, less mainstream pieces - for example from post-communism and feminism, and debates which have taken place over issues such as citizenship, migration and asylum - with the aim of engaging the reader with some of the contemporary debates which have reconfigured our understanding of nationalism.The overall aim of the Reader is to allow students to draw together and relate theories and debates within and across a range of disciplines, illuminating themes and issues of central importance in both historical and contemporary contexts, and showing how nationalism has evolved and has impacted upon and interacted with other political and social forms and forces.Following a substantial introduction which provides the historical background, the Reader is divided into six sections: (1) The Origins of Nationalism; (2) Approaches to Nationalism; (3) Differentiating Nationalism e\" Nationalism, Racism, Ethnicity; (4) Forms of Nationalism; (5) National Self-Determination and Nationalist Mobilisation; (6) Globalisation, Citizenship and Nationalism.Key Features:e Offers a mix of traditional texts from classic writers such as Gellner, Smith, Anderson and Breuilly and more innovative readings from fields such as post-communism and feminisme Covers topical debates surrounding citizenship, self-determination, and migratione The introduction provides the necessary historical background for understanding recent debates and places the contributions in their immediate contexte Clear guidance for further reading is given at the end of each section"

        "summary": "Interviews are a frequent and important part of empirical research in political science, but graduate programs rarely offer discipline-specific training in selecting interviewees, conducting interviews, and using the data thus collected. Interview Research in Political Science addresses this vital need, offering hard-won advice for both graduate students and faculty members. The contributors to this book have worked in a variety of field locations and settings and have interviewed a wide array of informants, from government officials to members of rebel movements and victims of wartime violence, from lobbyists and corporate executives to workers and trade unionists. The authors encourage scholars from all subfields of political science to use interviews in their research, and they provide a set of lessons and tools for doing so. The book addresses how to construct a sample of interviewees; how to collect and report interview data; and how to address ethical considerations and the Institutional Review Board process. Other chapters discuss how to link interview-based evidence with causal claims; how to use proxy interviews or an interpreter to improve access; and how to structure interview questions. A useful appendix contains examples of consent documents, semistructured interview prompts, and interview protocols. Contributors: Frank R.

Garc\u00eda compares restrictive and accommodating immigration measures in various cities and states to show that place-based inclusion and exclusion unfold in seemingly contradictory ways. Instead of fleeing restrictive localities, undocumented Mexicans react by presenting themselves as \u201clegal,\u201d masking the stigma of illegality to avoid local police and federal immigration enforcement. Restrictive laws coerce assimilation, because as legal passing becomes habitual and embodied, immigrants distance themselves from their ethnic and cultural identities. In accommodating destinations, undocumented Mexicans experience a localized sense of stability and membership that is simultaneously undercut by the threat of federal immigration enforcement and complex street-level tensions with local police. Combining social theory on immigration and race as well as place and law, Legal Passing uncovers the everyday failures and long-term human consequences of contemporary immigration laws in the US."

This collection of wide-ranging interventions and discussions on the status of the moving image in an age of advanced simulation explores the contemporary links between power, simulation, and warfare. Today, technological simulation has become an integral part of military training and operations; and at the same time, media spectacle\u2014often enabled by the same technologies\u2014has become integrated with military power. Trained in virtual environments, army personnel are increasingly enhanced by augmented reality technologies that bring combat into conformity with its simulation. Equally, the seductions of media and entertainment have become crucial weapons for \u201cinformation dominance.\u201d At the same time as the infosphere demands that war takes on the properties of a game, hyper-realistic videogames evolved from military technology become a kind of virtual distributed training camp, as the lines between simulation and action, combatant and civilian, become blurred. Based on a round table discussion prompted by the work of artist John Gerrard, Simulation, Exercise, Operations assembles thinkers from philosophy, media, and military theory to examine the powers of simulation in the contemporary world."

To impair the racial ordering of the world, The Black Technical Object introduces the history of statistical analysis and \u201cscientific\u201d racism into research on machine learning. Computer programming designed for taxonomic patterning, machine learning offers useful insights into racism and racist behavior, but its connection to the racial history of science and the Black lived experience has yet to be developed. In this book, Ramon Amaro explores how the history of data and statistical analysis informs the complex relationship between race and machine learning. He juxtaposes a practical analysis of this type of computerized learning with a theory of Black alienation in order to inspire alternative approaches to contemporary algorithmic practice. In doing so, Amaro contemplates the abstruse nature of programming and mathematics, as well as the deep incursion of racial hierarchies."

        "summary": "Winner of the Alan Bray Memorial Book Prize presented by the GL/Q Caucus of the Modern Language Association Finalist for the 2015 LGBT Studies Award presented by the Lambda Literary Foundation Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures and Other Latina Longings proposes a theory of sexual politics that works in the interstices between radical queer desires and the urgency of transforming public policy, between utopian longings and everyday failures. Considering the ways in which bodily movement is assigned cultural meaning, Juana Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez takes the stereotypes of the hyperbolically gestural queer Latina femme body as a starting point from which to discuss how gestures and forms of embodiment inform sexual pleasures and practices in the social realm. Centered on the sexuality of racialized queer female subjects, the book\u2019s varied archive\u2014which includes burlesque border crossings, daddy play, pornography, sodomy laws, and sovereignty claims\u2014seeks to bring to the fore alternative sexual practices and machinations that exist outside the sightlines of mainstream cosmopolitan gay male culture. Situating articulations of sexual subjectivity between the interpretive poles of law and performance, Rodr\u00edguez argues that forms of agency continually mediate among these various structures of legibility\u2014the rigid confines of the law and the imaginative possibilities of the performative. She reads the strategies of Puerto Rican activists working toward self-determination alongside sexual performances on stage, in commercial pornography, in multi-media installations, on the dance floor, and in the bedroom. Rodr\u00edguez examines not only how projections of racialized sex erupt onto various discursive mediums but also how the confluence of racial and gendered anxieties seeps into the gestures and utterances of sexual acts, kinship structures, and activist practices. Ultimately, Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings reveals \u2014in lyrical style and explicit detail\u2014how sex has been deployed in contemporary queer communities in order to radically reconceptualize sexual politics."

With a single drug in the UK currently costing \u00a3 340,000 per patient per year, or a gene therapy in the USA being costed at $1.2million, who should get such treatments, and how can we begin to afford them? Should we all be entitled to timely mental health therapy? How should we care for our old? As we grapple with the world's worst pandemic for a century, our minds are on our health more than ever. But what should we rightfully expect of doctors? In this original and thought-provoking book, Sir David Haslam explores what good healthcare should achieve and asks how we pay for it. Informed by patient stories and data from across the world - from US big pharma to Britain's NHS - this is an urgent and often moving examination of our most important asset: our health."

        "summary": "\"There are various methods for taking evidence abroad during litigation. This work focuses on two of them: 1. obtaining legal documents from a foreign national adversarial party during the main proceedings ('cross-border disclosure'), and 2. obtaining documents with the help of an auxiliary court, with the aim of introducing them as evidence during foreign civil proceedings ('evidence shopping'). It has a particular focus on the situation where a party wants to inspect information that their opponent has confidentially shared with a foreign (in-house) lawyer. In such instances, various questions arise. May the court grant the disclosure order based on the procedural law of its state? If so, how should the court determine the applicable law regarding possible legal privilege? Will this be the rules of its own state, or should the court apply a foreign state's rules on legal privilege instead? And does it make a difference whether the applicant requests disclosure during the main proceedings, or considering civil proceedings that will take place abroad? This book discusses these questions regarding the U.S. federal, English, French, German and Dutch legal systems.\"--"

But much of the debate surrounding legal tech has zoomed out to a nebulous future of 'robojudges' and 'robolawyers.' This volume is an antidote. Zeroing in on the near- to medium-term, it provides a concrete, empirically minded synthesis of the impact of new digital technologies on litigation and access to justice. How far and fast can legal tech advance given regulatory, organizational, and technological constraints? How will new technologies affect lawyers and litigants, and how should procedural rules adapt? How can technology expand-or curtail-access to justice? And how must judicial administration change to promote healthy technological development and open courthouse doors for all? By engaging these essential questions, this volume helps to map the opportunities and the perils of a rapidly digitizing legal system-and provides grounded advice for a sensible path forward\"--"

        "summary": "Male-dominated law and legal knowledge essentially characterized the whole of pre-modern history in that the patriarchy represented the axis of social relations in both the private and public spheres. Indeed, modern and even contemporary law still have embedded elements of patriarchal heritage, even in the secular modern legal systems of Western developed countries, either within the content of legislation or in terms of its implementation and interpretation. This is true to a greater or lesser extent across legal systems, although the secular modern legal systems of the Western developed countries have made great advances in terms of gender equality. The traditional understanding of law has always been self-evidently dominated by men, but modern law and its understanding have also been more or less \u201cmalestreamed.\u201d Therefore, it has become necessary to overcome the given \u201cmaskulinity\u201d of legal thought. In contemporary legal and political orders, gender mainstreaming of law has been of the utmost importance for overcoming deeply and persistently embedded power relations and gender-based, unequal social relations. At the same time and equally importantly, the gender mainstreaming of legal education \u2013 to which this book aims to contribute \u2013 can help to gradually eliminate this male dominance and accompanying power relations from legal education and higher education as a whole. This open access textbook provides an overview of gender issues in all areas of law, including sociological, historical and methodological issues. Written for students and teachers around the globe, it is intended to provide both a general overview and in-depth knowledge in the individual areas of law. Relevant court decisions and case studies are supplied throughout the book."

        "summary": "With employment contracts increasingly involving international elements, cases involving any international aspect require the application of rules of private international law to determine which court or tribunal can hear the case, and what law will be applied to determine the dispute. The Rome I and Rome II Regulations, and the Brussels I Regulation (BIR) all contain special regimes of rules for employment contracts, which have remained applicable in the UK following Brexit. This new edition includes an updated treatment of both the Rome Regulations, and a detailed chapter analysing the rules contained in the BIR recast, which replaced the Brussels I Regulation in 2015. Employment Contracts in Private International Law offers an exposition of the substantive law background, covering the jurisdictional and the choice of law rules to identify commonality and overlaps, and explore their rationale in order to provide a better understanding of each. It deals with the common law rules on jurisdiction, and emphasises how those rules are likely to apply in an employment context. The scope of the book includes coverage of the difficult overlapping provisions which apply to posted workers, as well as other claims which might arise out of the employment relationship such as claims in tort or for breach of statutory duty. Chapters tackle topics including the meaning of employment in national law and private international law; private international law issues involving international employment contracts; jurisdiction under the BIR and substantive changes following the recast; national jurisdiction rules; choice of law, mandatory rules particularly focusing on territorial scope; posted workers; and cross-border enforcement of restrictive covenants. Problematic areas of private international law - such as the difficult-to-negotiate role of tort law and its interaction with contract - are given special attention, and restrictive covenants are also addressed in a dedicated chapter. Each chapter is also usefully concluded in sections which summarise the analysis and scope of the coverage. The UK's withdrawal from the EU saw this country's legal system cease judicial co-operation with Member States in jurisdiction and the recognition of judgments. While the Brexit transition has been smoother for applicable law, with both the Rome I and Rome II Regulations being carried across into the body of 'retained EU law', and provisions relating to individual employment contracts being imported from the BIR recast into national law, the jurisdictional landscape for employees looks very different now. Employment Contracts in Private International Law is a timely new edition in view of the twin challenges of the post-Brexit legal landscape, and the rapid evolution of our understanding of the workplace as a result of technological advances and the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "summary": "\"A detailed examination of . . . the landmark 1964 Supreme Court decision that defined libel laws and increased protections for journalists.\"\u2014The New York Times Book Review \"A heroic narrative.\"\u2014The New Yorker A deeply researched legal drama that documents this landmark First Amendment ruling\u2014one that is more critical and controversial than ever. Actual Malice tells the full story of New York Times v. Sullivan, the dramatic case that grew out of segregationists' attempts to quash reporting on the civil rights movement. In its landmark 1964 decision, the Supreme Court held that a public official must prove \"actual malice\" or reckless disregard of the truth to win a libel lawsuit, providing critical protections for free speech and freedom of the press. Drawing on previously unexplored sources, including the archives of the New York Times Company and civil rights leaders, Samantha Barbas tracks the saga behind one of the most important First Amendment rulings in history. She situates the case within the turbulent 1960s and the history of the press, alongside striking portraits of the lawyers, officials, judges, activists, editors, and journalists who brought and defended the case. As the Sullivan doctrine faces growing controversy, Actual Malice reminds us of the stakes of the case that shaped American reporting and public discourse as we know it."

        "summary": "\"The widespread understanding of auction structure considers auction as consisting of three contracts: contract between the seller and the auctioneer, contract between the auctioneer and the buyer and the sale contract between the seller and the buyer. The book challenges this concept arguing that the traditional tripartite concept of auction is too narrow and does not correspond to the actual structure of auction relations. Demonstrating that an auction structure consists of a plethora of legal relationships, including non-contractual relations, this book explores the legal concept of auction sale and structure of accompanying relations. The book provides a historical overview of auctions and different auction models. Following a brief introduction to the economic theory, auction models are examined against the following legal criteria: price formation, publicity, parties' autonomy, legal form, and applied technology to find a legal concept and nature of auction. The book explores the legal position of key auction figures and auction objects to identify the categories of legal relations that appear at auction. It explores legal nature of the main contract, as well as relations between the consignor and the auctioneer, the auctioneer and the bidders, the bidders, the consignor and the bidders. The book covers relations arising from droit de suite, financial and bidding agreements to provide a comprehensive overview of less known legal relations that commonly arise in auction practice\"--"

        "summary": "Violent Affections uncovers techniques of power that work to translate emotions into violence against queer people. Based on analysis of over 300 criminal cases of anti-queer violence in Russia before and after the introduction of 'gay propaganda' law, the book shows how violent acts are framed in emotional language by perpetrators during their criminal trials. It then utilises an original methodology of studying 'legal memes' and argues that these individual affective states are directly connected to the political violence aimed at queer lives more generally. The main aim of Violent Affections is to explore the social mechanisms and techniques that impact anti-queer violence evidenced in the reviewed cases. Alexander Sasha Kondakov expands upon two sets of interdisciplinary literature - queer theory and affect theory - in order to conceptualise what is referred to as neo-disciplinary power. Taking the empirical observations from Russia as a starting point, he develops an original explanation of how contemporary power relations are changing from those of late modernity as envisioned by Foucault's Panopticon to neo-disciplinary power relations of a much more fragmented, fluid and unstructured kind - the Memeticon. The book traces how exactly affections circulate from body to body as a kind of virus and eventually invade the body that responds with violence. In this analytic effort, it draws on the arguments from memetics - the theory of how pieces of information pass on from one body to another as they thrive to survive by continuing to resonate. This work makes the argument truly interdisciplinary."

        "summary": "The present publication constitutively expands the field of discourse on the topic of basic income and explores the possibilities of its introduction as well as the opportunities and risks. Although all visionary proposals for an unconditional basic income (BGE) have so far not been implemented politically, at least in democratically constituted welfare states, the question of implementation or the conditions for success and the identification of possible blockades have only been dealt with marginally. Recent publications on a BGE also show this political-institutional \"blindness\" and do not address enough the reasons for the failure so far. Without a transfer strategy, however, the idea will fail in Germany due to such implementation naivety. In this book, therefore, the state of the debate on basic income is developed further to the extent that it is integrated into welfare-state development processes and current challenges for the \"safeguarding of social security\". In addition, a social-scientific classification of hitherto visionary guarantee elements of a basic income model is undertaken, linking up with the \"silent\" change to a socially investing state."

        "summary": "Perspectives from worldwide experts on how major cities across the globe are responding to the major environmental threats of our time, including global climate change Over half of the world's population now lives in cities, and this share is expected to increase in the coming decades. With growing urbanization, cities and their residents face substantial environmental challenges such as higher temperatures, droughts, wildfires, and increased flooding. In response to these pressing challenges, some cities have begun to develop local environmental regulations that supplement national and environmental laws. In so doing, cities have stepped into a role that has been historically dominated by higher levels of government.Global Sustainable Cities takes stock of the policies that have been implemented by cities around the world in recent years in several key areas: water, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate adaptation. It examines the advantages--and potential drawbacks--of allowing cities to assume a significant role in environmental regulation, given the legal and political constraints in which cities operate.The contributors present a series of case studies of the actions that seven leading cities--Abu Dhabi, Beijing, Berlin, Delhi, London, New York, and Shanghai--are taking to improve their environments and adapt to climate change. The first volume of its kind, Global Sustainable Cities is a critical comparative assessment of the actions that major cities in the global North and South are taking to advance sustainability."

In addition to offering specific solutions to issues arising in the context of the contract of sale, the book provides a non-contractual angle, putting forward suggestions under non-contractual mechanisms. Importantly, the book incorporates case law examples from the Commonwealth and the US. Dangerous goods that are carried by sea carry with them potential risks of losses and damages to the vessel, other cargoes and lives on board. The allocation of liability arising out of the carriage of dangerous goods has recently attracted unwelcome attention because of mis-declared cargoes leading to fires on board ships. Thus the book fills a gap in the literature by addressing the issue in detail with examples from multiple jurisdictions, and proposing solutions. In particular, the book analyses whether and to what extent the law of international sale of goods can provide any assistance in the re-allocation of liability between the buyer and the seller. This book will be of great interest to all those involved in the research as well as legal practice of international trade law and carriage of goods by sea law.\"--"

By the early 1970s, they 'had come to play a central role in the world economy', and currently occupy roughly one-third of world GDP. The number of TNCs has dramatically increased due to the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) business activities since the late 1970s. Meanwhile, large-scale TNCs have assumed as much economic and political power as many states. TNCs have thus become predominant providers of foreign direct investment (FDI). While sharply contrasting views exist on the relationship between FDI and economic growth in capital-importing countries, it remains a fact that FDI has become the second largest external source of capital for developing countries, following personal remittances\"--"

Conservation Law Enforcement provides a more general and comprehensive examination of the role of conservation officers in society. It includes chapters on topics such as, who conservation officers are, their history, the scope of conservation law enforcement in the United States and around the world, the important legal aspects, patrol strategies, and other various aspects of the important work of conservation officers.

        "summary": "The closure of religious houses, in varying circumstances, affected all of Europe at some point between the sixteenth and nineteenth century. At different times and in different countries the consequences were widely varied, in some cases preserving medieval and early modern collections intact, in others abandoning books to their fate, or transferring them piecemeal into new ownership to serve different cultural purposes. Integral preservation or dispersal may each be viewed in positive or negative terms. For religious and political history there are many, and bigger, factors involved, and the effects of secularization worked on many things beside libraries and books. None the less, by focusing on books and libraries through these changes a particular narrative emerges of great cultural importance. It is the most important book-historical story for the survival and accessibility of Europe's heritage of the written word, one that interacts with major historical themes and still connects with future issues for the continuing role of books and libraries in the European heritage. A conference held in Oxford in 2012 brought together thirty experts in different aspects of this process or with knowledge of its impact in different countries and at different periods. The result was to bring together and share for the first time the similar and different experiences of different European countries, from Portugal and Spain in the west to Poland and Ukraine in the east, from Finland and Sweden in the north to Naples in the south, with ramifications stretching to North and South America."

        "summary": "Effective persuasion is an art; an art which can be learned and perfected with practice and insight into human behaviour. This innovative book, written for lawyers and those interested in the science of persuasion in a legal setting, is the first to explain how key concepts from psychology, sociology, and communication science can be productively applied to the art of persuasion in international dispute resolution. Whilst success in arbitration relies upon knowledge of the law, sound judgment, and intelligence, it is also increasingly recognized that it is dependent upon the ability to effectively communicate with other people in order to convince them of a particular point of view. These are skills that can be acquired and enhanced over time with practice and experience. The focus of this book is to provide practitioners with insights and applications of the behavioural sciences that can assist in the development of those key skills associated with success in arbitration. Starting with an overview of the important elements of the psychology of persuasion, the book then provides recommendations and examples of how the information can be effectively utilized, with a view to providing a practical and pragmatic treatment of ideas and techniques of persuasion that lawyers can employ to enhance their advocacy skills. Prominent arbitrators from around the globe provide observations and anecdotes from their own arbitration experiences that offer context and provide the reader with fascinating insights into the experiences of some of the world's leading arbitrators. Taken together, the structure and analysis, backed up with real-world examples, gives readers the tools to gain \"the edge\" when it comes to using negotiation in their dispute resolution practice."

A narrow subset of fiscal measures, however, can be more directly aimed at improving health by targeting behaviours and risks that are known to be strongly associated with health outcomes. The purpose of this book is to discuss the subject of these measures, which we define as 'health taxes'. The book aims to enumerate key health taxes of interest, explore their positive and negative effects, and how these effects are influenced by the design of these taxes and the context in which they are applied. We ask how and where they can be implemented. Critically, we build an argument throughout the book for why policymakers across government should care about health taxes."

The work brings together different voices of legal, policy, and international affairs experts to construct a framework which addresses the complex and nuanced issues comprising the Rohingya crisis. While there is recognition that international legal mechanisms are moving forward more quickly than anticipated, these processes do not constitute standalone sustainable solutions. Myanmar's myriad political, social cohesion, development and security challenges are likely to persist even as justice and accountability processes move forward. Thus, this book project is premised on the consensus that the international community should complement international justice mechanisms by looking toward creative and multi-faceted approaches in addition to justice and accountability. This timely contribution will be of interest to academics, researchers, development practitioners and human rights organizations."

        "summary": "\"Global systemically important banks are the largest, most complex and, in the event of their potential failure, most threatening banking institutions in the world. The global financial crisis was a turning point for global systemically important banks, many of which contributed to the outbreak and severity of this downturn. The unfolding of the global financial crisis also revealed flaws and omissions in the legal framework applying to financial entities. In the context of global systemically important banks it clearly demonstrated that the legal regimes, both in the USA and in the EU, grossly ignored the specific character of these institutions and their systemic importance, complexity and individualism. As a result of this omission, these megabanks were long treated like any other smaller banking institution. Since the financial crisis legal systems have changed a lot since then on both sides of the Atlantic, global and national lawmakers have adopted new rules applying specifically to global systemically important banks to reduce their threat to financial stability. This book explores whether the regulatory frameworks related to G-SIBs are adequately tailored to their individualism in order to prevent them from exploiting overly general rules, as they did during the global financial crisis. Analysing the specific character and individualism of G-SIBs, in relation to their history, normal function, as well as their operations during the GFC the book the transformation of banking systems and the challenges and opportunities G-SIBs face, such as Big Tech competitors, climate-related requirements and the COVID-19 pandemic Taking a multidisciplinary approach which combines financial aspects of operations of G- SIBs and legal analysis the book describes G-SIB-oriented legal frameworks of the EU and the USA and assesses whether G- SIB individualism is adequately reflected, assessing trends in supervisory action when it comes to discretion in the G-SIB context to contribute to the ongoing discussions about international banking law, its problems and potential remedies to such persistent flaws\"--"

It fills a crucial gap in the literature with leading scholarship on the importance of natural law as a philosophical foundation for human rights and its significance for contemporary debates. The themes covered include: the role of natural law thought in the history of human rights; human rights scepticism; the different notions of 'subjective right'; the various foundations for human rights within natural law ethics; the relationship between natural law and human rights in religious traditions; the idea of human dignity; the relation between human rights, political community and law; human rights interpretation; and tensions between human rights law and natural law ethics. This Handbook is an ideal introduction to natural law perspectives on human rights, while also offering a concise summary of scholarly developments in the field.\"--"

        "summary": "Traces the longstanding relationship between technology and Black feminist thoughtBlack women are at the forefront of some of this century's most important discussions about technology: trolling, online harassment, algorithmic bias, and influencer culture. But, Catherine Knight Steele argues that Black women's relationship to technology began long before the advent of Twitter or Instagram. To truly \"listen to Black women,\" Steele points to the history of Black feminist technoculture in the United States and its ability to decenter white supremacy and patriarchy in a conversation about the future of technology. Using the virtual beauty shop as a metaphor, Digital Black Feminism walks readers through the technical skill, communicative expertise, and entrepreneurial acumen of Black women's labor--born of survival strategies and economic necessity--both on and offline.Positioning Black women at the center of our discourse about the past, present, and future of technology, Steele offers a through-line from the writing of early twentieth-century Black women to the bloggers and social media mavens of the twenty-first century. She makes connections among the letters, news articles, and essays of Black feminist writers of the past and a digital archive of blog posts, tweets, and Instagram stories of some of the most well-known Black feminist writers of our time. Linking narratives and existing literature about Black women's technology use in the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first century, Digital Black Feminism traverses the bounds between historical and archival analysis and empirical internet studies, forcing a reconciliation between fields and methods that are not always in conversation. As the work of Black feminist writers now reaches its widest audience online, Steele offers both hopefulness and caution on the implications of Black feminism becoming a digital product."

Our long-awaited sixth annual conference took place at Northumbria University in Newcastle with delegates from all around the world. This yearbook serves as a conference proceedings 'plus', collating all the stories, processes and methods we shared at that event. Among this year's contributors are: Andy Priestner, who argues that while culture might eat strategy for breakfast, UX can eat culture for dinner; Rebecca Blakiston, who shares her thoughts on how we might leverage organisational pain points and practice radical empathy; and Daniel Forsman, who calls for institutional alignment on the aspiration and value of UX work and a change in how senior staff operate. If you are just starting out in user experience work, or already employing UX techniques and seeking to embed a user-centred process in your library, then this is the publication for you."

        "summary": "Teaching Health Humanities expands our understanding of the burgeoning field of health humanities and of what it aspires to be. The volume's contributors describe their different degree programs, the politics and perspectives that inform their teaching, and methods for incorporating newerdigital and multimodal technologies into teaching practices. Each chapter lays out theories that guide contributors' pedagogy, describes its application to syllabus design, and includes, at the finer level, examples of lesson plans, class exercises, and/or textual analyses. Contributions also focus on pedagogies that integrate critical race, feminist, queer,disability, class, and age studies in courses, with most essays exemplifying intersectional approaches to these axes of difference and oppression. The culminating section includes chapters on teaching with digital technology, as well as descriptions of courses that bridge bioethics and music,medical humanities and podcasts, health humanities filmmaking, and visual arts in end-of-life care. By collecting scholars from a wide array of disciplinary specialties, professional ranks, and institutional affiliations, the volume offers a snapshot of the diverse ways medical/health humanities is practiced today and maps the diverse institutional locations where it is called upon to do work. Itprovides educators across diverse terrains myriad insights that will energize their teaching."

        "summary": "This new edition of The Routledge Companion to Design Research offers an updated, comprehensive examination of design research, celebrating a plurality of voices and range of conceptual, methodological, technological and theoretical approaches evident in contemporary design research. This volume comprises thirty-eight original and high-quality design research chapters from contributors around the world, with offerings from the vast array of disciplines in and around modern design praxis, including areas such as industrial and product design, visual communication, interaction design, fashion design, service design, engineering and architecture. The Companion is divided into four distinct sections with chapters that examine the nature and process of design research, the purpose of design research and how one might embark on design research. They also explore how leading design researchers conduct their design research through formulating and asking questions in novel ways, and the creative methods and tools they use to collect and analyse data. The Companion also includes a number of case studies that illustrate how one might best communicate and disseminate design research through contributions that offer techniques for writing and publicising research. The Routledge Companion to Design Research has a wide appeal to researchers and educators in design and design-related disciplines such as engineering, business, marketing, and computing, and will make an invaluable contribution to state-of-the-art design research at postgraduate, doctoral and post-doctoral levels and teaching across a wide range of different disciplines."

        "summary": "Examining the four main single player games in the franchise and its related spinoff games, this book explores the world of the popular role-playing video game, Fallout. Kenton Taylor Howard examines the maps of the games, the design of their worlds, and how the franchise has been expanded through fan-created video game modifications and tabletop games. This book highlights the importance of worldbuilding in the Fallout franchise, examining the extensive alternate history the game creates - diverging from real-world history in the early 1900s and resulting in a world that is destroyed by nuclear apocalypse in 2077 - and exploring how the series builds this detailed world over the course of many games. The book also examines how the franchise has served as an extended commentary on American militarism and expansionism. The series is closely examined through the lens of critical media studies, as well as relying on theoretical frameworks relating to video game design and world design. This book will be of interest to students, scholars, and enthusiasts of video game studies, video game design, media fandom and fan studies, transmedia studies, and imaginary worlds."

        "summary": "The consequences of the federal Housing Act of 1949--which supported the clearance and redevelopment of \"blighted\" areas across the nation--were felt by communities of all sizes, not just large cities. The Many Geographies of Urban Renewal presents a more comprehensive view of the federal urban renewal program by situating the experiences of large cities like Baltimore, MD and Philadelphia PA alongside other geographies, such as the small city of Waterville, ME, suburban St. Louis County in Missouri, the State of New York, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and others. Chapters identify trends and connections that cut across jurisdictional boundaries, investigate who used federal funds, how those funds were used, and examine the profound short and long-term consequences of the program. Taken as a whole, the essays showcase the unexpected diversity of how different communities used the federal urban renewal program. The Many Geographies of Urban Renewal allows us to better understand what was arguably the most significant urban policy of the 20th century, and how that policy shaped the American landscape. Contributors include Francesca Russello Ammon, Brent Cebul, Robert B. Fairbanks, Leif Fredrickson, Colin Gordon, David Hochfelder, Robert K. Nelson, Benjamin D. Lisle, Stacy Kinlock Sewell and the editor."

        "summary": "\"The subject of bank stability has been under a great amount of political and legislative scrutiny since the mid-2007 - late-2009 global financial crisis. However, these efforts have centered on developed economies. Little coverage is given to strategies adopted by many developing economies. While there is a global discourse on the subject of insolvency generally, there is ample scope to contribute to the growing body of work on the narrow subject of bank insolvencies. This book provides a unique perspective on an emerging theme in at least two respects. First is the focus on selected developing economies and selected developed economies in the EMEA region alongside cross-border developments, with the objective of deciphering the regulatory approach to bank insolvencies. The second is the analytical consideration of methods that may be implemented to preclude or resolve bank insolvencies in developing economies. This book explores the nexus between developing economies and their banking institutions. Developing economies are acutely dependent on their banks for the functioning of their cash-based economies. Recent events, however, suggest a weakness in the long-term viability of some of their banks and a mixed-bag regulatory approach to redress this weakness. This book evaluates the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks in selected developing economies that are designed to prevent or resolve the insolvency of banks. At a time of global economic uncertainty, this book will prove to be a valuable resource to the discourse on the viability of banks, businesses, and economies in developing States\"--"

        "summary": "Inequities and health disparities are the greatest and most pressing social issues of our time. This book explores public health practice through the critical lens of social and structural justice by examining our approach to health and what it means to be healthy, systemically and structurally. Through recent events, the raw reality of health disparities and inequities have been exposed. These events are earmarked by COVID-19's decimating and disparate impacts on Black and Brown populations during one of the greatest social movements of our time to end racism. Since this very public explosion of intersecting forms of oppression and inequitable suffrage, many have clamored to make sense of it, to reframe our narratives toward action, and re-envision what progress and change could look like. This text is positioned as a tool to help professionals dismantle old ways of thinking while reconstructing new ones that can be more responsive in meeting the realities of today. The author challenges the reader to think about public health more deeply and pragmatically as the space for reconciling solutions to these poignant health issues. This requires the exploration of an ideological shift in how we think of health, how we prepare healthcare providers outside of an antiquated sick care system, and how we prioritize the determinants of health across a re-imagined continuum of care. The scope of this book ranges from a historical and structural examination of our beliefs about health to perceiving a more just system of care where health is intentionally co-created toward this aim. It intentionally explores health along the lines of equity and through the broader lens of the social determinants of health to shed light on the opportunity in this moment that public health creates for health care. Justice in Health is a timely and important resource for healthcare professionals (pre- and post-licensure) and healthcare decision-makers. The book also appeals more widely to instructors, academics, researchers, and students across disciplines of nursing, medicine, public heath, sociology, and social work."

Each chapter focuses on a single court decision related to health law. The decisions concern patient autonomy, informed consent, medical and nursing malpractice, the relationships among health care professionals and the institutions where they work, communications between health care providers and the patients they serve, end-of-life care, reproductive health care, biomedical research, ownership of human tissues and cells, the influence of religious directives on health care standards, health care discrimination, equitable access to long-term care in nursing homes, equitable access to community-based alternatives, private health insurance, Medicaid coverage, the Affordable Care Act, and more. Each chapter begins with a commentary from a scholar who puts the case in historical context, summarizes the original opinion, discusses what makes the rewritten opinion feminist, and describes how a feminist approach might have altered subsequent developments in health law. The feminist judgments take the form of rewritten majority opinions, concurrences, and dissents. The opinion authors are scholars who inhabit the role of a judge deciding the case. They rely exclusively on the factual record, precedents, and scientific understanding available at the time of the original decision to show how a judge with a feminist perspective could have adjudicated the matter differently\"--"

        "summary": "How can politicians and ordinary citizens face the racial past in a country that frames itself as colorblind? In her timely and provocative book, Resurrecting Slavery, Crystal Fleming shows how people make sense of slavery in a nation where talking about race, colonialism, and slavery remains taboo. Noting how struggles over the meaning of racial history are informed by contemporary politics of race, she asks: What kinds of group identities are at stake today for activists and French people with ties to overseas territories where slavery took place? Fleming investigates the connections and disconnections that are made between racism, slavery, and colonialism in France. She provides historical context and examines how politicians and commemorative activists interpret the racial past and present. Resurrecting Slavery also includes in-depth interviews with French Caribbean migrants outside the commemorative movement to address the everyday racial politics of remembrance. Bringing a critical race perspective to the study of French racism, Fleming\u2019s groundbreaking study provides a more nuanced understanding of race in France along with new ways of thinking about the global dimensions of slavery, anti-blackness, and white supremacy."

        "summary": "A behind-the-scenes account of American foreign policymaking in the late twentieth century Tom Hughes, assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research, made an ominous prediction in 1965. In a seminal but less well-known document of the Vietnam War, Hughes predicted that the Democratic Party and the national consensus underlying the nation's foreign policy would break apart if the war escalated. Hughes drafted the memo for his friend and fellow Minnesotan for whom he had previously worked as legislative counsel, Senator Hubert Humphrey. Humphrey had just been elected Vice President. The memo called on President Johnson to seek negotiations to end the war, but clearly failed to persuade him. Tom Hughes saw his prediction come true. Hughes served in the State Department through 1970 and then for 20 years as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He worked to reestablish a professional, bipartisan foreign policy for the United States and to make the foreign service more open and democratic. He also built the Carnegie Endowment into the nation's leading foreign policy think tank, and he remained influential in foreign policy circles. In this impressive biography, Bruce L. R. Smith tells the story of this remarkable life, which also reflects much of the story of America in the last half of the twentieth century. Through the eyes, diary, and notes of a key participant, the book provides a contemporaneous perspective on such major events as the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the CIA's Operation Mongoose against the Castro regime, the Cuban missile crisis, Vietnam, and the elections of the 1960s. This book is a firsthand, behind-the-scenes account of the people who dealt with the great issues and made critical life-and-death decisions for America during the cold war."

Zhang shows how the state frames love as a set of desires that encompass heteronormative intimacy, familial and communal attachment, upward mobility, and private property ownership. These desires\u2014as circulated in performance in the nationalistic ceremony, same-sex romantic fan fiction, the wildly popular reality television dating show If You Are the One, and the cult of patriarchal personality around Xi Jinping\u2014are explicitly based in oppressive systems of gender, class, and sexuality. Zhang contends that such desires connect love to economic survival and gender normativity in ways that underwrite Chinese neoliberalism at the expense of individual flourishing. By outlining how state-framed forms of love create desires that cannot be fulfilled, Zhang places China at the forefront of using affective attachments to nation, leader, and family in the global shifts toward exploitation and authoritarianism."

        "summary": "When approaching the multiplicity of the spiritual experiences of healing, ethnographers are often presented with ideas of the existence of \"other\" worlds that may intersect with the so-called \"material\" or \"physical\" worlds. This book proposes a sensory ethnography of healing with a focus on ethnographic knowing as embedded in an embodied epistemology of healing. Epistemological embodiment signals that personal scholarly experience of the \"unknown\"--be it in the form of trance, or as the embodiment of an \"other\"--shapes the concepts of healing, body, trance, self, and matter by which ethnographers craft out analysis."

Behind the meme is a thoughtfully reported book that greatly contributes to our understanding of generational change.\u201d \u2014Irin Carmon, coauthor of the New York Times bestseller Notorious RBG Baby Boomers are the most prosperous generation in American history, but their kids are screwed. In this eye-opening book, journalist Jill Filipovic breaks down the massive problems facing Millennials including climate, money, housing, and healthcare. In Ok Boomer, Let\u2019s Talk, journalist (and Millenial) Jill Filipovic tells the definitive story of her generation. Talking to gig workers, economists, policy makers, and dozens of struggling Millennials drowning in debt on a planet quite literally in flames, Filipovic paints a shocking and nuanced portrait of a generation being left behind: -Millennials are the most educated generation in American history\u2014and also the most broke. -Millennials hold just 3 percent of American wealth. When they were the same age, Boomers held 21 percent. -The average older Millennial has $15,000 in student loan debt. The average Boomer at the same age? Just $2,300 in today\u2019s dollars. -Millennials are paying almost 40 percent more for their first homes than Boomers did. -American families spend twice as much on healthcare now than they did when Boomers were young parents. Filipovic shows that Millennials are not the avocado-toast-eating snowflakes of Boomer outrage fantasies. But they are the first American generation that will do worse than their parents. \u201cOK, Boomer\u201d isn\u2019t just a sarcastic dismissal\u2014it\u2019s a recognition that Millennials are in crisis, and that Boomer voters, bankers, and policy makers are responsible. Filipovic goes beyond the meme, upending dated assumptions with revelatory data and revealing portraits of young people delaying adulthood to pay down debt, obsessed with \u201cwellness\u201d because they can\u2019t afford real healthcare, and struggling to #hustle in the precarious gig economy. Ok Boomer, Let\u2019s Talk is at once an explainer and an extended olive branch that will finally allow these two generations to truly understand each other."

        "summary": "This innovative textbook applies basic dance history and theory to contemporary popular culture examples in order to examine our own ways of moving in - and through - culture. By drawing on material relevant to students, Dance in US Popular Culture successfully introduces students to critical thinking around the most personal of terrain: our bodies and our identities. The book asks readers to think about: what embodied knowledge we carry with us and how can we understand history and society through that lens what gender and racialized stereotypes are embedded in performance and what expectations accompany them how are such expectations reinforced, negotiated, challenged, embraced, or rescripted altogether? how readers articulate their own sense of complex identity within the constantly shifting landscape of popular culture, how this shapes an active sense of their everyday lives, and how can this act as a springboard towards dismantling systems of oppression Through readings, questions, movement analyses, and assignment prompts that take students from computer to nightclub, Dance in US Popular Culture readers develop their own sense of dance and the moving body's sociopolitical and cultural importance while also determining how dance might be fundamentally applicable to their own sense of identity. This is the ideal textbook for high school and undergraduate students of dance and dance studies in BA and BfA courses, as well as those studying popular culture from interdisciplinary perspectives including cultural studies, media studies, communication studies, theatre and performance studies."

Taking a transcultural perspective by also discussing Christian and Jewish apocalyptic traditions, it offers in eight studies and three appendices a typology of apocalypses and many new insights into the matter. For instance, historical apocalypses as well as apocalyptic figures, like the Dajj\u0101l, the Sufy\u0101n\u012b and the Mahd\u012b are discussed. Moreover, apocalyptic \u1e25ad\u012bth literature, in particular Nu\u02bfaym b. \u1e24amm\u0101d's (d. 844) Kit\u0101b al-Fitan, and apocalyptic material in tafs\u012br works are presented. The author argues for a comprehensive understanding of this important feature of the Islamic religious tradition. \"... a reference tool and a starting point for students in their study of early Islam\" (Sajjad Rizvi)"

From 1939-1944, the Haut-Nyong area of French Cameroon was placed under the authority of David and five other French doctors. Expanding efforts to rein in epidemics that had depopulated the region, David was given authority to refashion the Medical Region as a laboratory for a utopian dream at the heart of European colonialism: the fantasy that colonial powers would emancipate their colonies from misery, ignorance, and sickness. David was thus freed from political and military influence to reform government, law, and economy according to his vision of rational public health policy-and he used this mandate to build hospitals, introduce new crops, and implement totalitarian control and violence. Drawing on African and Pacific histories, environmental humanities, and critical global health, Lachenal situates Dr. David's experiment in the context of French imperialism, examining its precedents and afterlives from the Polynesian islands to post-war Africa. He traces the destiny of a failed utopia, interweaving David's biography with a captivating account of his fieldwork to unearth the traces it left in contemporary places, objects, songs, memories, and ruins\"--"

Often expressed as hatred and discrimination against women, misogyny is the legal aftermath of patriarchy, which goes beyond attacking and belittling women. After Misogyny reframes misogyny as society's overentitlement to women's forbearance and sacrifices, which continues to be expressed in the law even after patriarchy has been repudiated. Women's contributions, both inside and outside the home, are radically undercompensated and highly beneficial to society-especially the reproductive work of childbearing and childrearing. From antidiscrimination law to abortion bans, the law fails women by keeping the dynamics of social overentitlement and male overempowerment invisible. In recent years, many constitutional democracies have used new processes of constitution-making and constitutional change to reset entitlements and power. After Misogyny shows how movements to reset these baseline entitlements are necessary for constitutional democracies to overcome misogyny\"--"

It provides in-depth treatment of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Designed for use by law students, scholars, and practitioners, the book identifies the critical elements of disparate treatment and disparate impact theory and proof requirements for claims of harassment and retaliation. Separate sections address distinctive issues relating to religious discrimination, pregnancy and caregiver discrimination, pay equity suits and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The book covers U.S. Supreme Court precedents as well as developments and trends in the lower courts."

        "summary": "Strategies and Tactics of Behavioral Research and Practice focuses on the most effective methods for measuring and evaluating changes in behavior. The authors provide the rationale for different procedures for measuring behavior and designing within-subject comparisons between control and intervention conditions. The text explains the strengths and weaknesses of methodological alternatives for every topic so that behavioral researchers and practitioners can make the best decisions in each situation. This classic text has been extensively revised to be more accessible and practical. Not only does it feature much more discussion of how research methods are relevant to today's practitioners, it also includes additional examples based on field research and service delivery scenarios. With expanded coverage on creating experimental designs, as well as new chapters on behavioral assessment, the statistical analysis of data, and ethical issues associated with research methods, this book provides a strong foundation for direct behavioral measurement, within-subject research design, and interpretation of behavioral interventions. Enriched with more pedagogical features, including key terms, tables summarizing important points, figures to help readers visualize text, and updated examples and suggested readings, this book is an invaluable resource for students taking courses in research methods. This book is appropriate for researchers and practitioners in behavior analysis, psychology, education, social work, and other social and health science programs that address questions about behavior in research or practice settings."

It turns community thinking on its head by understanding community not as an object but as a relational process with sociality at its core. Based on fieldwork from one market town and the work of Hannah Arendt, it demonstrates how a new approach to social practices can illuminate our understanding of commonality and communal being. Whilst community has become both a much-derided and much-touted term, this thought-provoking work shows that it is at the heart of social process. It will appeal to researchers of sociology, social policy, politics, public health and geography, as well as those involved in public policy design and implementation."

        "summary": "Just as the new technology of photography was emerging throughout the United States in the mid-nineteenth century, it quickly caught hold in the scenic Adirondack region of upstate New York. Young men and a few women began to experiment with cameras as a way to earn their livings with local portrait work. From photographing individuals, some expanded their subject matter to include families and groups, homes, streetscapes, landmarks, workplaces, and important events: from town celebrations to presidential visits, train wrecks, floods, and fires. These photographers from within and just beyond the Park borders, as well as many who immigrated from other countries, have been central in defining the Adirondacks. Adirondack Photographers, 1850\u20131950 is a comprehensive look at the first one hundred years of photography through the lives of those who captured this unique rural region of New York State. Svenson\u2019s fascinating biographical dictionary of over two hundred photographers is enriched with over seventy illustrations. While the popularity of some of these photographers\u2019 images is reflected in public collections such as the Library of Congress, the New York Public Library, and the Getty Center, little is known about the diverse backgrounds of the men and women behind their work. A compilation of captivating stories, Adirondack Photographers provides a vivid, intimate account of the evolution of photography, as well as an unusual perspective on Adirondack history."

        "summary": "A fascinating exploration of how the growth of digital mapping, spurred by sensing technologies, is affecting cities and daily lives What have smart technologies taught us about cities? What lessons can we learn from today's urbanites to make better places to live? Antoine Picon and Carlo Ratti argue that the answers are in the maps we make. For centuries, we have relied on maps to navigate the enormity of the city. Now, as the physical world combines with the digital world, we need a new generation of maps to navigate the city of tomorrow. Pervasive sensors allow anyone to visualize cities in entirely new ways--ebbs and flows of pollution, traffic, and internet connectivity. This book explores how the growth of digital mapping, spurred by sensing technologies, is affecting cities and daily lives. It examines how new cartographic possibilities aid urban planners, technicians, politicians, and administrators; how digitally mapped cities could reveal ways to make cities smarter and more efficient; how monitoring urbanites has political and social repercussions; and how the proliferation of open-source maps and collaborative platforms can aid activists and vulnerable populations. With its beautiful, accessible presentation of cutting-edge research, this book makes it easy for readers to understand the stakes of the new information age--and appreciate the timeless power of the city."

Henry at Work overturns the popular perception of Thoreau as a navel-gazing recluse, scornful of work and other mundanities. Just the opposite, they argue, Thoreau worked hard and thought intensely about work: why we do it, what we hope to gain from it, and what it does to us. They aim to show readers not only Thoreau the writer and philosopher, but also the lesser-known Thoreau: Thoreau the worker, economist, and even the efficiency expert\"--"

Featuring the work of 85 poets from mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore, it contains more than 280 poems that span the entire history of modern Chinese poetry. Poets include those regarded as canonical as well as some who have been newly ?discovered? or reevaluated in recent years, each selected for their distinctive voice and inimitable style. Also, for the first time, contemporary song lyrics are included as poetry. This diversity of perspectives, along with its geographic reach and expansive timeframe, make the anthology a much-needed contribution to the study of Chinese poetry and world literature. With short biographies of the poets, a select bibliography, and a comprehensive introduction, A Century of Modern Chinese Poetry is a critical resource for students, scholars, and general readers alike."

Bringing together perspectives from a rich range of disciplines and experiences, it is an invaluable resource on issues related to commercial sex in the transgender community and in the lives of trans sex workers, including mental health, substance use, relationship dynamics, encounters with the criminal justice system, and opportunities and challenges in the realm of public health. The volume covers trans sex workers' interactions with health, social service, and mental-health agencies, featuring more than forty contributors from across the globe. Synthesizing introductions by the editor help organize and put into context a vast and scattered research and empirical literature.

        "summary": "Collaboration between ethnographers and subjects has long been a product of the close, intimate relationships that define ethnographic research. But increasingly, collaboration is no longer viewed as merely a consequence of fieldwork; instead collaboration now preconditions and shapes research design as well as its dissemination. As a result, ethnographic subjects are shifting from being informants to being consultants. The emergence of collaborative ethnography highlights this relationship between consultant and ethnographer, moving it to center stage as a calculated part not only of fieldwork but also of the writing process itself. The Chicago Guide to Collaborative Ethnography presents a historical, theoretical, and practice-oriented road map for this shift from incidental collaboration to a more conscious and explicit collaborative strategy. Luke Eric Lassiter charts the history of collaborative ethnography from its earliest implementation to its contemporary emergence in fields such as feminism, humanistic anthropology, and critical ethnography. On this historical and theoretical base, Lassiter outlines concrete steps for achieving a more deliberate and overt collaborative practice throughout the processes of fieldwork and writing. As a participatory action situated in the ethical commitments between ethnographers and consultants and focused on the co-construction of texts, collaborative ethnography, argues Lassiter, is among the most powerful ways to press ethnographic fieldwork and writing into the service of an applied and public scholarship. A comprehensive and highly accessible handbook for ethnographers of all stripes, The Chicago Guide to Collaborative Ethnography will become a fixture in the development of a critical practice of anthropology, invaluable to both undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty alike."

Riding and Stein are important figures in twentieth-century poetry and poetics and are considered progenitors of later movements such as L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry. The editors contextualize their relationship and its time period with an introduction; annotations to the letters; and supplementary materials, including pieces by Stein and Riding that exemplify their singular perspectives on modernism as well as their personal poetics. The book provides unique insight into Stein's and Riding's writing processes as well as the larger literary world around them, making it a must-read for anyone interested in twentieth-century poetry."

        "summary": "In Echo and Critique, Florian Gargaillo skillfully charts the ways that poets have responded to the clich\u00e9s of public speech from the start of the Second World War to the present. Beginning around 1939, many public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic lamented that the political lexicon had become saturated with bureaucratic stock phrases such as \u201cthe fight for freedom,\u201d \u201crevenue enhancement,\u201d and \u201cservice the target,\u201d designed for the mass media and used to euphemize, obfuscate, and evade. Instead of ridding their writing of such language, many poets parroted these tropes as a means of exploring the implications of such expressions, weighing their effects, and identifying the realities they distort and suppress. With its attentiveness to linguistic particulars, poetry proved especially well-suited to this innovative mode of close listening and intertextual commentary. At the same time, postwar poets recognized their own susceptibility to dead language, so that co-opting political clich\u00e9s obliged them to scrutinize their writing and accept the inevitability of cant while simultaneously pushing against it. This innovative study blends close readings with historical context as it traces the development of echo and critique in the work of seven poets who expertly deployed the method throughout their careers: W. H. Auden, Randall Jarrell, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Robert Lowell, Josephine Miles, and Seamus Heaney. Gargaillo\u2019s analysis reveals that poetry can encourage us to listen diligently and critically to the insincerity ubiquitous in public discourse."

        "summary": "The global economy is at a crossroads. Can finance fix it? Proponents of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing say yes. They claim that new financial strategies that consider all stakeholders are essential tools for addressing runaway carbon emissions and stark income inequality, among other ills. ESG-integrated investments already encompass more than $120 trillion in financial assets. Is this approach really leading to better social and environmental outcomes for all? If not, how can it be improved? In Sustainable, a finance-industry veteran offers an insider's look at the promises, prospects, and limitations of ESG investing and provides comprehensive solutions that would promote more optimal outcomes. Terrence Keeley argues that both activist and C-suite advocates have been overly optimistic about what ESG can accomplish. Divestment threats are ineffective tools for altering corporate behavior, and verifiably \"good\" companies do not systematically generate great returns. Most importantly, business and finance cannot achieve inclusive, sustainable growth on their own: regulators, public policies, civil society, and individuals must all play specific, complementary roles to shape the future we need. In particular, Keeley recommends reallocating capital from indexed ESG products toward an emerging class of strategies with more verifiable social and environmental benefits. He identifies alternative \"impact investing\" strategies that can generate true double bottom lines. The book also highlights organizations that promote inclusive, sustainable economic growth. Proposing practical and actionable solutions to social and environmental problems, Sustainable offers an incisive vision of the roles business and finance can play in building a flourishing society."

        "summary": "WHY THIS DIRECTORY IS NEEDED With a total population of more than 50 million, the disabled constitute America's largest (and fastest growing) \"minority\" group. Each year, billions of dollars in financial aid are set aside to assist persons with disabilities, along with members of their families. But, how can these individuals find out about the available funding? While numerous print and online listings have been prepared to identify and describe general financial aid opportunities (those open to all segments of society), none of those resources have covered more than a small portion of the programs designed primarily or exclusively at individuals with disabilities or their family members. That's why Gail A. Schlachter and R. David Weber biennially issue Financial Aid for Persons with Disabilities and Their Families (formerly published as Financial Aid for the Disabled and Their Families), which identifies billions of dollars set aside each year specifically for members of these groups to support study, research, creative activities, travel, career development, emergencies, and much more. WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THIS DIRECTORY Financial Aid for Persons with Disabilities and Their Families is the first and only publication to identify and provide comprehensive information on the nearly 1,400 programs established to provide funding to those with physical, sensory, or other disabilities, as well as to their family members. The listings in this book cover every major field of study, are sponsored by more than 600 different private and public agencies and organizations, and are open to all levels of applicants - from high school and college students to professionals, postdoctorates, and others. And, not only does Financial Aid for Persons with Disabilities and Their Families provide the most comprehensive coverage of available funding, it also displays the most informative program descriptions (on the average, more than twice the detail found in any other listing). In addition to this extensive and focused coverage, the 2018-2020 edition of the directory offers several other unique features. First, all funding described here is substantial; every program offers at least $1,000, and many award $10,000 or more. Even better, all of this is \"free\" money; not one dollar will ever need to be repaid (provided, of course, recipients meet the program requirements). Another plus: you can take the money awarded by these funding programs to any number of locations. Unlike other financial aid directories, which often list large numbers of scholarships available only to students enrolled at one specific school, all of the entries in this book are \"portable.\" And, many of the programs listed here have never been covered in other financial aid directories. So, even if you have searched elsewhere, you will want to look here for new leads."

        "summary": "In this brilliant book, \u02bbAbdulw\u0101\u1e25id Lu'lu'a translates and introduces eighty poems from one of the pioneers of modern Arabic poetry, Buland Al-\u1e24aidari. Buland Al-\u1e24aidari might fairly be considered the fourth pillar holding up the dome of modern Arabic poetry. Alongside his famous contemporaries N\u0101zik al-Mal\u0101'ika, Badre Sh\u0101kir Al-Sayy\u0101b, and 'Abdulwahh\u0101b Al-Bayy\u0101ti, Al-\u1e24aidari likewise made significant contributions to the development of twentieth-century Arabic poetry, including the departure from the traditional use of two-hemistich verses in favor of what has been called the Arabic \"free verse\" form. A few of Al-\u1e24adairi's poems have been translated into English separately, but no book-length translation of his poetry has been published until now. In Buland Al-\u1e24aidari and Modern Iraqi Poetry, \u02bbAbdulw\u0101\u1e25id Lu'lu'a translates eighty of Al-\u1e24aidari's most important poems, giving English speaking readers access to this rich corpus. Lu'lu'a's perceptive introduction acquaints readers with the contours of Al-\u1e24aidari's life, and situates his work in the context of modern Arabic poetry. The translated pieces not only illustrate the depth of Al-\u1e24aidari's poetic imagination but also showcase the development of his style, from the youthful romanticism of his first collectionClay Throb (1946) to the detached pessimism of his Songs of the Dead City (1951). Selections are also included from his later collections Steps in Exile (1965), The Journey of Yellow Letters (1968), and Songs of the Tired Guard (1977). These poems paint a vivid picture of the literary and poetic atmosphere in Baghdad and Iraq from the mid-1940s to the close of the twentieth century."

        "summary": "Duns Scotus's Doctrine of Categories and Meaning is a key text for the origins of Martin Heidegger's concept of \"facticity.\" Originally submitted as a doctoral thesis in 1915, it focuses on the 13th-century philosopher-theologian John Duns Scotus. Heidegger first analyzes Scotus's doctrine of categories, then offers a meticulous explanation of the Grammatica Speculativa, a work of medieval grammar now known to be authored by the Modist grammarian Thomas of Erfurt. Taken together, these investigations represent an early foray into Heidegger's lifelong philosophical concerns, \"the question of being in the guise of the problem of categories and the question of language in the guise of the doctrine of meaning.\" This new and unique translation of one of Heidegger's earliest works offers an important look at his early thinking before the question of being became his central concern and will appeal to readers exploring Heidegger's philosophical development, medieval philosophy, phenomenological interpretations of the history of philosophy, and the philosophy of language."

As scholarship has continued to evolve, this revised and expanded third edition offers indispensable meditations on new and developing concepts used in American studies, cultural studies, and beyond. Designed as a uniquely print-digital hybrid publication, this Keywords volume collects 114 essays, each focused on a single term such as \u201cAmerica,\u201d \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cdiversity,\u201d or \u201creligion.\u201d More than forty of the essays have been significantly revised for this new edition, and there are nineteen completely new keywords, including crucial additions such as \u201cbiopolitics,\u201d \u201cdata,\u201d \u201cdebt,\u201d and \u201cintersectionality.\u201d Throughout the volume, interdisciplinary scholars explore these terms and others as nodal points in many of today\u2019s most dynamic and vexed discussions of political and social life, both inside and outside of the academy. The Keywords website features forty-eight essays not in the print volume; it also provides pedagogical tools for instructors using print and online keywords in their courses. The publication brings together essays by interdisciplinary scholars working in literary studies and political economy, cultural anthropology and ethnic studies, African American history and performance studies, gender studies and political theory. Some entries are explicitly argumentative; others are more descriptive. All are clear, challenging, and critically engaged. As a whole, Keywords for American Cultural Studies provides an accessible A-to-Z survey of prevailing academic buzzwords and a flexible tool for carving out new areas of inquiry."

        "summary": "For good reasons, the rise of veterans studies has occurred within the discipline of writing studies, with its interdisciplinary approach to scholarship, pedagogy, and community outreach. Writing faculty are often a point of first contact with veteran students, and writing classrooms are by their nature the site of disclosures, providing opportunities to make connections and hear narratives that debunk the myth of the stereotypical combat veteran of popular culture. D. Alexis Hart and Roger Thompson offer rich academic inquiry into the idea of \"the veteran\" as well as into ways that veteran culture has been fostered or challenged in writing classrooms, in writing centers, and in college communities more generally. Presenting a more nuanced approach to understanding \"the veteran\" leads not only to more useful research, but also to more wide-ranging and significant scholarship and community engagement. Such an approach recognizes veterans as assets to the college campus, encourages institutions to customize their veterans programs and courses, and leads to more thoughtful engagement with veterans in the writing classroom."

        "summary": "Drawing on original archival research in the rhetoric of civil rights, the author explores this largely underexamined rhetorical studies site In Liturgy of Change: Rhetorics of the Civil Rights Mass Meeting, Elizabeth Miller examines civil rights mass meetings as a transformative rhetorical, and religious, experience. While rhetorical scholars have analyzed other components of the civil rights movement, including sit-ins, marches, and voter registration campaigns, as well as meeting speeches delivered by well-known figures, the mass meeting itself still is a significant but underexamined site in rhetorical studies. Miller's \"liturgy of change\" framework brings attention to the pattern of religious genres--song, prayer, and testimony--that structured the events, and the ways these genres created rhetorical opportunities for ordinary people to speak up and develop their activism. To recover and reconstruct these patterns, Miller analyzes archival audio recordings of mass meetings held in Greenville and Hattisburg, Mississippi; Montgomery, Selma, and Birmingham, Alabama; Savannah, Sumter, and Albany, Georgia; St. Augustine, Florida; and Danville, Virginia."

        "summary": "In this book, renowned anthropologist Michael Jackson draws on philosophy, biography, ethnography, and literature to explore the meanings and affordances of friendship--a relationship just as significant as, yet somehow different from, kinship and love. Beginning with Aristotle's accounts of friendship as a political virtue and Montaigne's famous essay on friendship as a form of love, Jackson examines the tension between the political and personal resonances of friendship in the philosophy of Hannah Arendt, the biography of the Indian historian Brijen Gupta, and the oral narratives of a Kuranko storyteller, Keti Ferenke Koroma. He offers reflections on childhood friends, imaginary friends, lifelong friendships, and friendships with animals. He ruminates particularly on the complications of friendship in the context of anthropological fieldwork, exploring the contradiction between the egalitarian spirit of friendship on the one hand and, on the other, the power imbalance between ethnographers and their interlocutors. Through these stories, Jackson explores the unpredictable interplay of mutability and mutuality in intimate human relationships, and the critical importance of choice in forming friendship--what it means to be loyal to friends through good times and bad, and even in the face of danger. Through a blend of memoir, theory, ethnography, and fiction, Jackson shows us how the elective affinities of friendship transcend culture, gender, and age, and offer us perennial means of taking stock of our lives and getting a measure of our own self-worth."

        "summary": "This authoritative and comprehensive book makes the reader familiar with the processes of bringing orphan drugs to the global market. There are between 5,000 and 7,000 rare diseases and the number of patients suffering from them is estimated to be more than 50 million in the US and Europe. Before the orphan drug legislation enacted in the US in 1983, there was a limited interest from industry to develop treatment for very small patient groups. One of the difficulties is, of course, that similar levels of investment are needed from a pharmaceutical company to bring a drug to the market for both small and large patient groups. The journey from application of an orphan drug designation to a reimbursed market- approved drug is long and many obstacles occur during the journey. After reading the book, readers will: Understand who the players/stakeholders are in the rare orphan disease field and their specific needs and concerns: patients and patient organizations, researchers and treating physicians within the field, industry, regulatory and reimbursement bodies* Understand the strong partnership between the different players and the various initiatives to improve and increase access to treatment for patients; minimizing the gap between numbers of known diseases, orphan designations, approved drugs and paid drugs. The book also provides short practical case stories from patients and researchers, as well as representatives from industry and authorities on the challenges they came across in developing orphan drugs or getting access to orphan drugs."

The second edition of Rape Challenging Contemporary Thinking - 10 years on, is not a traditional new edition, although it does provide updated versions of substantive issues covered in the first edition. Bringing the book to the cutting edge, it incorporates both old and new contexts where sexual exploitation takes place identifying some knowledge gaps especially when considering voices of complainants/victims/survivors who are invisible or muted. numerous new areas of research including the implications arising from #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements, the limitations of our present criminal justice systems, and radical alternatives to closing the justice gap. The new book reflects the global reach of research and thinking about rape, including more international coverage, with material for the India, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand as well as the UK. In order to learn from our shared history in this field and two authors reflect on their careers and other authors were encouraged others to move away from conventional academic formats to convey their stories. Bringing together leading researchers in the field from psychology, sociology and law, considering new research and presenting new data from a strong theoretical and contextual base, the chapters are provocative and engage in innovative thinking, whilst remaining grounded in the available evidence. This book is essential reading for students of criminology, forensic psychology, sociology, criminal justice, law, media studies and women's/gender studies. It also aims to inform professionals engaged in the investigation, prosecution of rape, support and preventative services."

        "summary": "This book examines music stores as sites of cultural production in contemporary India. Analyzing social practices of selling music in a variety of retail contexts, it focuses upon the economic and social values that are produced and circulated by music retailers in the marketplace. Based upon research conducted over a volatile ten-year period of the Indian music industry, Beaster-Jones discusses the cultural histories of the recording industry, the social changes that have accompanied India's economic liberalization reforms, and the economic realities of selling music in India as digital circulation of music recordings gradually displaced physical distribution. The volume considers the mobilization of musical, economic, and social values as a component of branding discourses in neoliberal India, as a justification for new regimes of legitimate use and intellectual property, as a scene for the performance of cosmopolitanism by shopping, and as a site of anxiety about transformations in the marketplace. It relies upon ethnographic observation and interviews from a variety of sources within the Indian music industry, including perspectives of executives at music labels, family-run and corporate music stores, and hawkers in street markets selling counterfeit recordings. This ethnography of the practices, spaces, and anxieties of selling music in urban India will be an important resource for scholars in a wide range of fields, including ethnomusicology, anthropology, popular music studies, and South Asian studies."

        "summary": "The Amon Carter Museum of American Art exhibition Speaking with Light: Contemporary Indigenous Photography provides a major museum examination of contemporary Indigenous photography across the United States. This groundbreaking project summarizes how these artists have taken over the conversation about how their cultures and lives are depicted through their dynamic embrace of three interwoven themes: Survivance, Nation, and Indigenous Visuality. The photographers demand that their existence, perspectives, and troubling history be acknowledged, as they enact a key shift away from privileging settler-colonialism, foregrounding instead an Indigenous sense of community and visuality. Speaking with Light: Contemporary Indigenous Photography reveals and examines these Indigenous artists? explorations of themes like identity, the contribution of customary practice to contemporary life, belonging, and the assistance that Indigenous worldviews can provide to building healthier relationships with each other and the earth. The book, like the exhibition, is comprised of four sections bridged by transitions and ending with a globalization of the discussion. Texts by key Indigenous scholars are followed by a series of plates illustrating many of the exhibition works. Not an exhibition catalogue per se, Speaking with Light: Contemporary Indigenous Photography is a summary statement about the preoccupations and dynamism of Indigenous photography today.00Exhibition: Amon Carter Museum of American Art, Fort Worth, USA (30.10.2022 - 22.01.2023)."

She has dedicated her work to exploring issues of personal and collective identity through photographs of female adolescence and womanhood--both in the United States where she lives, and in the Middle East where she is from. Rania Matar: She focuses on young women in their late teens and early twenties, who are leaving the cocoon of home, entering adulthood and facing a new reality. Depicting women in the United States and the Middle East, this project highlights how female subjectivity develops in parallel forms across cultural lines. Each young woman becomes an active participant in the image-making process, presiding over the environment and making it her own. Matar portrays the raw beauty of her subjects--their age, individuality, physicality and mystery--and photographs them the way she, a woman and a mother, sees them: beautiful, alive."

The book strikes a balance between comprehensiveness and selectivity, thus providing students with assurance that they know enough, know it well, but are not overwhelmed by details that are unduly esoteric or irrelevant to their performance needs. The seventh edition covers all of the recent relevant decisions, including Iancu v. Brunetti; Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck; Matal v. Tam; The American Legion v. American Humanist Assocation; National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra; Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky; Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. V. Colorado Civil Rights Commission; Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman; Packingham v.

        "summary": "This highly original book reconsiders canonical long eighteenth-century narratives through the conjoined lenses of queer studies and the environmental humanities. Moving from Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels to Gothic novels including Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Jeremy Chow investigates the role that bodies of water play in reading these central texts. Chow navigates various representations and phases of water to magnify the element's furtive yet pronounced effects on narrative, theory, and identity. Water, Chow reveals, is both a participant and a stage upon which bodily violation manifests. The sea, rivers, pools, streams, and glaciers all participate in a violent decolonialism that fractures, revises, and reshapes notions of colonial masculinity emerging throughout the long eighteenth century. Through an innovative series of intermezzi, The Queerness of Water also traces the afterlives of eighteenth-century literature in late twentienth- and twenty-first-century film, television, and other popular media, opening up conversations regarding canon, literary criticism, pedagogy, and climate change."

The book weaves archival images, found ephemera, and narrative text that examines how spiritualism continues to thrive through scams, startups, self-care companies, and other lucrative industries."

        "summary": "Based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork among aged Mexican migrants in Chicago, Franziska Bedorf investigates the phenomenon of return migration by tracing how people's intentions to go back change over time. Considering global labor mobility, she evaluates transformations of belonging and the wider economic, political, social and cultural frameworks that shape them. Against the backdrop of debates on integration, transnationalism and belonging, the study explores why migrants keep and form attachments to and detachments from places, people, and cultures."

        "summary": "Medical science in antebellum America was organized around a paradox: it presumed African Americans to be less than human yet still human enough to be viable as experimental subjects, as cadavers, and for use in the training of medical students. By taking a hard look at the racial ideas of both northern and southern medical schools, Christopher D. E. Willoughby reveals that racist ideas were not external to the medical profession but fundamental to medical knowledge. In this history of racial thinking and slavery in American medical schools, the founders and early faculty of these schools emerge as singularly influential proponents of white supremacist racial science. They pushed an understanding of race influenced by the theory of polygenesis--that each race was created separately and as different species--which they supported by training students to collect and measure human skulls from around the world. Medical students came to see themselves as masters of Black people's bodies through stealing Black people's corpses, experimenting on enslaved people, and practicing distinctive therapeutics on Black patients. In documenting these practices Masters of Health charts the rise of racist theories in U.S. medical schools, throwing new light on the extensive legacies of slavery in modern medicine."

        "summary": "This book provides in-depth results and case studies in innovation from actual work undertaken in collaboration with industry partners in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC). Scientific advances and innovative technologies in the sector are key to shaping the changes emerging as a result of Industry 4.0. Mainstream Building Information Management (BIM) is seen as a vehicle for addressing issues such as industry fragmentation, value-driven solutions, decision-making, client engagement, and design/process flow; however, advanced simulation, computer vision, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, machine learning, deep learning, and linked data all provide immense opportunities for dealing with these challenges and can provide evidenced-based innovative solutions not seen before. These technologies are perceived as the \"true\" enablers of future practice, but only recently has the AEC sector recognised terms such as \"golden key\" and \"golden thread\" as part of BIM processes and workflows. This book builds on the success of a number of initiatives and projects by the authors, which include seminal findings from the literature, research and development, and practice-based solutions produced for industry. It presents these findings through real projects and case studies developed by the authors and reports on how these technologies made a real-world impact. The chapters and cases in the book are developed around these overarching themes: - BIM and AEC Design and Optimisation: Application of Artificial Intelligence in Design - BIM and XR as Advanced Visualisation and Simulation Tools - Design Informatics and Advancements in BIM Authoring - Green Building Assessment: Emerging Design Support Tools - Computer Vision and Image Processing for Expediting Project Management and Operations - Blockchain, Big Data, and IoT for Facilitated Project Management - BIM Strategies and Leveraged Solutions This book is a timely and relevant synthesis of a number of cogent subjects underpinning the paradigm shift needed for the AEC industry and is essential reading for all involved in the sector. It is particularly suited for use in Masters-level programs in Architecture, Engineering, and Construction."

There are over 200 mother tongues spoken in Canada, and at least 5.8 million Canadians use two or more languages at home. This vital anthology opens a dialogue about this unique language diversity and probes the importance of language in our identity and the ways in which it shapes us. In this collection of deeply personal essays, twenty-six writers explore their connection with language, accents, and vocabularies, and contend with the ways they can be used as both bridge and weapon. Some explore the way power and privilege affect language learning, especially the shame and exclusion often felt by non-native English speakers in a white, settler, colonial nation. Some confront the pain of losing a mother tongue or an ancestral language along with the loss of community and highlight the empowerment that comes with reclamation. Others celebrate the joys of learning a new language and the power of connection. All underscore how language can offer transformation and collective healing to various communities.

        "summary": "'Sustainment' (as commonly defined by industry and government), is comprised of maintenance, support, and upgrade practices that sustain or improve the performance of a system and maximize the availability of goods and services while minimizing their cost and footprint or, more simply, the capacity of a system to endure. Sustainment is a multi-trillion-dollar enterprise for critical systems, in both government (infrastructure and defense) and industry (transportation, industrial controls, data centers, and energy generation).This book is a mix of engineering, operations research, and policy sciences intended to provide students with a thorough understanding of the concept of sustainability and sustainable product life-cycles, and an appreciation of the importance of sustaining critical systems. It starts from the key attributes for system sustainment that includes data analytics, engineering analysis and the public policy needed to support the development of technologies, processes, and frameworks required for the management of sustainable processes and practices. The specific topics covered include: acquisition of critical systems, reliability, maintenance, availability, readiness, inventory management, supply-chain management and risks, contracting for sustainment, and various analysis methodologies (discounted cash flow analysis, discrete-event simulation and Monte Carlo methods). Practice problems are included at the end of each chapter."

        "summary": "From the author of the New York Times best seller Poser and the acclaimed memoir Love and Trouble, a passionate, provocative, blisteringly smart interrogation of how we make and experience art in the age of #MeToo, and of the link between genius and monstrosity. In this unflinching, deeply personal book that expands on her instantly viral Paris Review essay, \"What Do We Do with the Art of Monstrous Men?\" Claire Dederer asks: Can we love the work of Hemingway, Polanski, Naipaul, Miles Davis, or Picasso? Should we love it? Does genius deserve special dispensation? Is male monstrosity the same as female monstrosity? Does art have a mandate to depict the darker elements of the psyche? And what happens if the artist stares too long into the abyss? She explores the audience's relationship with artists from Woody Allen to Michael Jackson, asking: How do we balance our undeniable sense of moral outrage with our equally undeniable love of the work? In a more troubling vein, she wonders if an artist needs to be a monster in order to create something great. And if an artist is also a mother, does one identity inexorably, and fatally, interrupt the other? Highly topical, morally wise, honest to the core, Monsters is certain to incite a conversation about whether and how we can separate artists from their art."

        "summary": "This new edition of Phillis Wheatley Peters is the first full-length biography of the poet whose remarkable odyssey took her from being a child enslaved in Africa to becoming an international celebrity by the time she was in her early twenties, only to fall into relative obscurity when she died in 1784 at barely the age of thirty. Introduced to Benjamin Franklin in London, praised by her correspondent George Washington, and criticized by Thomas Jefferson, Phillis Wheatley (later Peters) laid claim to being the virtual poet laureate during the American Revolution as well as in the new United States. She overcame contemporaneous restraints of age, gender, race, and social status to assert her position as the unofficial spokesperson and critical observer of the nation that claimed to be founded on the principle that all men are created equal. Grounded in extensive primary research, Phillis Wheatley Peters recovers her life and times and reclaims the recognition and status she deserves as a heroic literary and political figure in an age of heroes. She is indisputably the founder of African American literature. Contemporary African American authors, including Nikki Giovanni, Amanda Gorman, Honor\u00e9e Fanonne Jeffers, June Jordan, and Alice Walker, celebrate Phillis Wheatley Peters's transcendent literary achievement and influence. This new edition incorporates significant discoveries that Vincent Carretta and others have made since the book's initial publication about Wheatley's education, affiliations, activities, publications, marriage, husband, maternity, later years, and the posthumous survival of the manuscript of her proposed second volume of writings. Moreover, this new edition gives Carretta the opportunity to reconsider some previously available evidence."

        "summary": "The Concise Hornbook Principles of Arbitration Law is an authoritative and extensively cited treatise on arbitration. It thoroughly discusses general arbitration law--from federal preemption of state law to the formation, performance, and enforcement of arbitration agreements--and provides in-depth coverage of specialized law governing international arbitration and labor arbitration. The last few decades have witnessed the growth of a large body of legal doctrine--from statutes, judicial decisions, and other sources--focused on arbitration. This Concise Hornbook summarizes that body of law, so should be useful to lawyers and scholars researching arbitration law and to students learning about arbitration. This Concise Hornbook is designed to be used as the primary or secondary text in a law school course. Many teachers of arbitration design their courses to develop a wide array of practice skills, generally through the use of role-playing exercises. Because this book is clear and concise, students reading it can quickly gain a solid understanding of arbitration's central concepts and legal doctrines. This efficient use of time enables the teacher to devote many class sessions to role-playing exercises, and discussion of them. This Concise Hornbook can also serve as the primary text for arbitration seminars. Before venturing into a field of scholarship, students generally need a solid foundation in the field's central concepts and legal doctrines. This book provides that foundation with only a limited amount of reading, thus enabling students to devote substantial time to the seminar's more-advanced work of reading scholarly articles and writing original papers."

This second edition which came out in January 2021, includes images of the vaccine promising hope for the end of the pandemic. In the style of colorist painting, the book sequence reveals the tension between the seductive aesthetics of the picture and its deadly pandemic effect. While scientific images transform into editorial illustrations, the book gains momentum building a narrative toward a sci-fi ending. The second edition includes images of social inequities brought out by the pandemic and the discovery of vaccines. Like photographs made of the Kennedy assassination, the Challenger disaster, and the terror of 9/11, the iconic imagery of Covid-19 collected in Drop Dead Gorgeous is informed by a world wide visual lexicon specific to this moment.\"--Colophon."

        "summary": "\"This book analyzes how over the last two decades, immigration regimes in three, primary refugee-receiving states in the Global North - Canada, Australia, and the UK - have engaged with allegations about witchcraft-driven violence made by asylum seekers coming from Anglophone countries across the African continent. The work intervenes at the nexus of anthropological, historical, legal, developmental, and human rights literatures to offer fresh insights into extrajudicial violence and global migration. Taking witchcraft-based asylum cases as its focal point, it argues that the recent, dramatic expansion in claims to refugee protection under the \"particular social group\" category of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention reflects immigration authorities' increasing willingness to consider how legally recognizable persecution can derive from cultural practices and beliefs. Reflecting critically on such cases, it advances understandings of how witchcraft beliefs and practices have persisted as significant engines of violence in the contemporary world. It sheds light both on the limits of legal pluralism and cultural relativism in asylum adjudication and on how social scientific expertise contributes not simply to the flow of ideas, but also to the channelling of people across national, cultural, and epistemological boundaries. The book will be essential reading for students and researchers in legal anthropology, African studies, human rights, transnational history, migration and refugee law and policy, and the history and anthropology of witchcraft\"--"

Formed in 1990 as an experimental studio, the full-service firm has grown into a team of 50 architects, planners, landscape architects, interior designers and graphic designers. Although Promontorio works predominantly within their country of origin, it casts a wide net, geographically and functionally speaking, developing projects across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the US that serve a diverse roster of needs--from schools, museums and cultural institutions to housing, offices, hotels and retail. The practice is distinguished by its penchant for sharp lines and concrete, as emblematized by the Egyptian consulate building in Lisbon (2017), AC Marriott Portsmouth Hotel in Portsmouth, New Hampshire (2017) and Harvard Square Theater in Cambridge (2021, with Merge Architects)."

Researchers using scientific methods and approaches to advance our understanding of music and musicality have not yet grappled with some of the perils that humanistic fields concentrating on music have long articulated. In this edited volume, established and emerging researchers -- neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, musicians, historical musicologists, and ethnomusicologists -- build bridges between humanistic and scientific approaches to music studies, particularly music psychology. Deftly edited by Elizabeth H. Margulis, Psyche Loui, and Deirdre Loughridge, The Science-Music Borderlands embodies how sustained interaction among disciplines can lead to a richer understanding of musical life. The essays in this volume provide the scientific study of music with its first major reckoning, exploring the intellectual history of the field and its central debates, while charting a path forward. The Science-Music Borderlands is essential reading for people studying music from any disciplinary background. It will also interest those working at the intersection of music and science, such as music teachers, performers, composers, and music therapists."

It contains the first logical and orderly discussion of a number of modern business issues including outsourcing, turnaround management, layoffs, quality management, and reengineering. Now in its third edition, Harlan D. Platt has revised, updated, and expanded the text. As the first edition did, this new Principles of Corporate Renewal cuts to the heart of the patterns, procedures, and pitfalls of bringing a corporation back to life and health. New and exciting materials in this edition include factors to consider on the first day of a turnaround assignment and essential turnaround questions that help assess and focus the turnaround effort. This is a highly readable book on a fairly complex topic."

Corporate renewal, as a topic taught and discussed in business schools, has surged in the past decade. The cases in this book were selected to cover the knowledge and skills needed by successful turnaround managers, including ethical and legal issues; developing a plan of reorganization; and defining problems and their solutions, including strategic, financial, and operating issues. The cases challenge students to actively engage in the decision-making process in order to learn how corporate renewal is practiced in real business settings. The Casebook is meant to accompany the third edition of Principles of Corporate Renewal by Harlan D. Platt, but it can be adopted separately or used with other management textbooks."

        "summary": "Gathering insightful and stimulating contributions from leading global experts in Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), this comprehensive Handbook traces the development of AIED from its early foundations in the 1970s to the present day. The Handbook evaluates the use of AI techniques such as modelling in closed and open domains, machine learning, analytics, language understanding and production to create systems aimed at helping learners, teachers, and educational administrators. Chapters examine theories of affect, metacognition and pedagogy applied in AIED systems; foundational aspects of AIED architecture, design, authoring and evaluation; and collaborative learning, the use of games and psychomotor learning. It concludes with a critical discussion of the wider context of Artificial Intelligence in Education, examining its commercialisation, social and political role, and the ethics of its systems, as well as reviewing the possible challenges and opportunities for AIED in the next 20 years. Providing a broad yet detailed account of the current field of Artificial Intelligence in Education, researchers and advanced students of education technology, innovation policy, and university management will benefit from this thought-provoking Handbook. Chapters will also be useful to support undergraduate courses in AI, computer science, and education."

It introduces readers to the complexity of Judaism as it has developed and continues to develop throughout the 21st century through the prism of three contemporary sets of issues: identities and geographies; structures and power; and knowledge and performances. Within these sections, international contributors examine central issues, topics, and debates, including: Individual and collective identity; globalization and localization; Jewish demography; diversity, denominations, and pluralism; interreligious relations; political orientations; community organization; family and gender; the Bible and Talmud today; Jewish philosophy and authority in Jewish thought; digital Judaism; antisemitism; Jewish spirituality and rituals; memory; language; religious education; material culture, literature, music, and art; approaches to the environment; and contemporary Zionism and Israel. The Handbook also includes an extensive bibliography to help orient readers to the most important and leading work in the field. The Routledge Handbook of Judaism in the 21st Century is essential reading for students and researchers in religious studies and Jewish studies. It will also be useful for those in related fields, such as cultural studies, literature, sociology, anthropology, and history, as well as Jewish professionals and lay leaders\"--"

No Bosses, No Gods argues that Karl Marx is essential for reversing course\u2014but it will take letting go of what most scholars think they know about him. The book\u2019s first half draws on the scholarship of international specialists\u2014as well as new translations of the original German texts\u2014to present Marx the anti-theorist, a political journalist deeply skeptical about what happens when the professoriate sits down to \"theorize\" about social worlds. The second half appeals to this modified portrait of Marx and charts a new course beyond both actually existing religious studies and contemporary genealogies of the religion category. The result, perhaps, is an academic study of religion worth having in the twenty-first century."

        "summary": "China's rise is currently reconfiguring the established global order. Recently, Beijing has been reviving ancient Chinese religious traditions to present a more curated, softer image of the PRC to the world at large. This book examines the resurging influence of the ancient Chinese sacred ethos, exploring how a rejuvenated Confucian-Daoist-Buddhist moral enterprise may shape the evolving character of modern China. It covers subjects ranging from social-political reform to inter-civilizations engagement, and from bioethical issues to environmental concerns. The book also argues for a stronger affirmation of the traditional Chinese ideals of universalism, pluralism, and moderation, as prescriptions to remedy the ills afflicting contemporary China. More broadly, this philosophical and religious studies-based research will serve to deepen the reader's comprehension of the extraordinary changes taking place in China today."

        "summary": "The United States Space Force, the sixth branch of the armed forces, will soon play a leading role in American foreign policy and will be necessary to protect its economic, political, and social interests at home and abroad. This book argues that America's newest branch of the armed forces, the United States Space Force, will soon play a key strategic role in American foreign policy, military and economic expansion, and technological innovation. Written by a leading expert on and member of the Space Force, the book offers an introduction to the Space Force, explains the urgent need for it, and walks readers through what exactly the Space Force is and is not. Drawing on dozens of interviews with high-ranking members of the armed forces, the author claims that, in the future, space will be the geopolitical center of world politics, as such countries as the U.S., Russia, and China jockey for control of it. America must therefore set aside partisan politics to make space a top priority, as a failure to do so will leave the U.S. and its citizens in a dangerous and vulnerable position on the world stage."

        "summary": "\"This book is the first comprehensive investigation of the architecture of the apartheid state in the period of economic growth, social engineering and political repression from 1957 to 1966 when buildings took on ideological and nationalistic roles that were never remote from the increasingly predominant administrative, legislative and policing mechanisms of the regime. The book examines in detail how this process reflected the usurpation of regionalism and the International Style and contributes to the wider discourse on international post-war modernism in architecture. A group of key state building projects in Pretoria that came to embody the ambitions of the apartheid regime for industrialisation and progress serve as detailed case studies. Architects drew heavily on the idea of modernity and the vernacular, as the relationship between the agricultural rural and industrialised urban was transforming in the capital city of Pretoria. Grappling with architectural form in an age of enormous technological change had challenged architects' intent on giving expression to the idea of a shared modernity as much as an embrace of 'western civilization.' There was an understanding by the governing Nationalist Party of the symbolic resonance of highly visible buildings in the apartheid capital. Yet these buildings were being erected to consolidate a white presence in Africa just as black South Africans were being forcibly removed from the city, and the built environment was being stripped of contested traditional and everyday cultural traces of the entire black population. This book will appeal to students and scholars in architectural history as well as those with an interest in postcolonial studies, political science and social anthropology\"--"

        "summary": "Winner of the Society of Architectural Historians' 2014 Antoinette Forrester Downing Book Award; Winner of the University of Mary Washington Center for Historic Preservation's 2012 Historic Preservation Book Award \"Dear Mrs. Freeman: I am glad to know that you are still happily 'at home.' Sincerely, Frank Lloyd Wright.\" Winner of The University of Mary Washington Center for Historic Preservation's 2012 Historic Preservation Book Prize, this book is a case study on the preservation of an important work of modern architecture. The story of the Freeman House, and of the attempt to save it, entails almost all of the provocative issues that make historic preservation as a field so fascinating, technologically and theoretically complex, and politically charged. Saving Wright chronicles the ongoing struggle to save Wright\u2019s Freeman House in the Hollywood Hills, the setting for fascinating people and events but deeply flawed from the time it was built ninety-five years ago. The Freeman House was an experiment born out of Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s polemical vision of a new kind of architecture for the middle class, for modern America, and, in particular, for the Los Angeles foothills. Its design and construction were difficult, thus, along with many poor decisions, planting within a beautiful work of architecture the seeds of its own destruction. Jeffrey M. Chusid, who lived in the house and studied it while Harriet Freeman was still alive and residing there and, later, after she gave it to the School of Architecture at the University of Southern California, examines the experimental \u201ctextile-block\u201d construction system, the power of Wright\u2019s architecture, the interaction of people and place, and the concepts and challenges of historic preservation\u2014why and how we do it. The Freeman House is a valuable case study because it serves as a test of established preservation procedures and protocols, of building forensics and conservation techniques, and of the meaning of a historic site to overlapping and not necessarily compatible communities. Saving Wright also received an honorable mention for the 2012 Lee Nelson Book Award from the Association for Preservation Technology, Intl. (APT)."

Entertainingly written by an expert on architecture, it provides a concise history of the subject, and offers a fascinating resource to dip into for the general reader. Starting with the basic building 'components' of door, window, column and beam and the Classical orders, it then goes on to explore historical movements such as the Picturesque and Beaux-Arts, innovative materials such as steel and reinforced concrete, technical innovations, such as the lift and electric lighting, through to modern movements such as Universal Design and Deconstruction. Arranged in a broadly chronological order, the ideas are presented through informative text and arresting visuals, exploring when each idea first evolved and the subsequent impact it has had up to the present day."

        "summary": "The Ballad of Sexual Dependency is a visual diary chronicling the struggle for intimacy and understanding between friends, family, and lovers--collectively described by Goldin as her \"tribe.\" Her work describes a world that is visceral, charged, and seething with life. First published in 1986, this reissue recognizes the persistent relevance and freshness of Nan Goldin's cutting-edge photography. Her lush color photography and candid style demand that the viewer go beyond the surface to encounter a profound intensity. As Goldin writes: \"Real memory, which these pictures trigger, is an invocation of the color, smell, sound, and physical presence, the density and flavor of life.\" Through an accurate and detailed record of her life, Ballad reveals Goldin's personal odyssey as well as a more universal understanding of the different languages men and women speak, and the struggle between autonomy and dependency. Over the past twenty-five years, the influence of Ballad on photography and other aesthetic realms has continually grown, making the work a contemporary classic. Nan Goldin's story of urban life on the fringe was the swan song of an era that reached its peak in the early eighties. Yet it has captured an important element of humanity that is transcendent: a need to connect. This new paperback edition of The Ballad of Sexual Dependency has been printed using new scans and separations created by master separator Robert Hennessey from Goldin's original transparencies, rendering them with unparalleled sumptuousness and impact."

        "summary": "This book charts the personal and professional journey of Greg Doran, Artistic Director of the Royal Shakespeare Company from 2012 until 2022 and \"one of the great Shakespearians of his generation\" (Sunday Times). During his illustrious career, Doran has directed or produced all of the plays within Shakespeare's First Folio -- a milestone reached in the same year that the world celebrates the 400th anniversary of its original publication. Each chapter looks at a different play, considering the choices made and weaving in both autobiographical detail and background on the RSC, as well as giving insights into key collaborations, including those with actors such as Judi Dench, David Tennant, Harriet Walter, Patrick Stewart, Simon Russell Beale, Paterson Joseph and Doran's husband, the late Antony Sher, as well as seminal practitioners such as Cicely Berry, John Barton and Terry Hands. The book also includes 16 striking pages with stills from some of the RSC plays. Through Doran's account of this extraordinary journey, we see how Henry VIII, initially regarded as a poisoned chalice, became his lucky break; how the tragedy of 9/11 unfolded during a matinee of King John and how the language of the play went some way in helping to articulate the unfathomable; how a RSC supporter bequeathed their skull to the company to be used as Yorick in Hamlet; how meeting Nelson Mandela inspired the production of Julius Caesar; how Falstaff was introduced to China for the very first time; and how arachnophobia informed the production of Macbeth. This book uniquely captures the excitement, energy, surprises, joys and agonies of working on these greatest of plays; sheds new light on these plays through Doran's own research and discoveries made in the rehearsal room; and gives unprecedented access into the craft, life and loves of this exceptional director."

        "summary": "An unfiltered, personal and intense account of Xylella, the plant epidemic that threatens Europe; Fastidiosa is the result of Caimi + Piccinni photographing the plight of local farmers and environmental devastation in Puglia, southern Italy, over a period of six years. Working under the project title This Land is My Land, the duo were in the groves with farmers facing the destruction of their history, culture and livelihood, as they were forced to cut down heritage olive trees to prevent the spread of infection into northern Europe. Millions of trees have already been felled, and there is no known cure for the disease. Fastidiosa features a dramatic mix of black and white analogue portraits and landscapes, colour images highlighting scientific research and experimental efforts, with archival photographs and words from residents of the region."

        "summary": "An adaptation of Olaudah Equiano's Interesting Narrative published for Black children in 1829, now given new life in a major scholarly edition. In 1829, Samuel Wood and Sons, a New York publisher of children's literature, printed and sold the Quaker Abigail Field Mott's Life and Adventures of Olaudah Equiano. Mott adapted Olaudah Equiano's Interesting Narrative, a bestselling autobiography first published in London in 1789 for Black children studying at New York African Free Schools, one of the first educational systems to teach individuals of African descent in the United States. By reissuing Mott's neglected adaptation with contextualizing scholarly apparatus, Eric D. Lamore disrupts the editorial tradition of selecting a London edition of Equiano's Interesting Narrative, and positions Equiano in the United States instead of Great Britain. Lamore's volume contains Mott's children's book, which includes a series of illustrations, in a facsimile edition; instructive notes on Life and Adventures; a provocative essay on the adaptation; and selections from relevant texts on the New York African Free Schools and other related topics. With its focus on the intersections of early Black Atlantic and American studies, children's literature, history of education, life writing, and book history, this edition offers a fresh take on Equiano and his autobiography for a variety of twenty-first-century audiences."

In order to grow, the church needs to reapproach topics long understood as external threats to the organization, such as feminism, gender equality, racial inclusivity, and queerness-topics that Diefendorf classifies as the \"imagined secular\" in the mind of evangelicals. She finds that the church's ways of reworking their messages to appear more welcoming still uphold already privileged identities\"--"

Each chapter is written by practicing coordinators, who share their experiences leading information literacy programs that are nimble, responsive, and supportive of student learning. The volume discusses the work of instruction coordinators within 5 thematic areas: Claiming our Space within higher education and our institutions; Moving and Growing together; Curriculum Development; Meaningful Assessment; and Leading Change. Readers will gain insight from their colleagues' advice for situating information literacy within the higher education institution, developing meaningful curricula, and using assessment in productive ways. Many of the stories represent a departure from traditional models of library instruction. In addition, this book is sure to spark inspiration for innovative approaches to program leadership and development, including strategies for developing communities of practice. From leadership skills and techniques, methods for cultivating shared values, pedagogical approaches, team building, assessment strategies - and everything in between - the aspiring or practicing instruction coordinator has much to gain from reading this work."

        "summary": "This book presents a model of Practitioner Inquiry (PI) as a systematic form of empirical research and provides a rationale for its suitability within a writing center context. Exploring the potential of writing centers as pedagogical sites that support research, the book offers an accessible model that guides both research and practice for writing center practitioners, while offering flexibility to account for their distinct contexts of practice. Responding to the increasing call in the field to produce empirical \"RAD\" (replicable, aggregable, data-driven) research, the author explores Practitioner Inquiry through explication of methodology and methods, a revisitation of collaboration to guide both practice and research, and examples of application of the model. Nordstrom grounds this research and scholarship in Hawai\u02bbi's context and explores Indigenous concepts and approaches to inform an ethical collaborative practice. Offering significant contributions to empirical research in the fields of writing center studies, composition, and education, this book will be of great relevance to writing center practitioners, anyone conducting empirical research, and researchers working in tutor professionalization, collaboration, translingual literacy practices, and researchmethodologies."

        "summary": "History in a Post-Truth World: Theory and Praxis explores one of the most significant paradigm shifts in public discourse. A post-truth environment that appeals primarily to emotion, elevates personal belief, and devalues expert opinion has important implications far beyond Brexit or the election of Donald Trump, and has a profound impact on how history is produced and consumed. Post-truth history is not merely a synonym for lies. This book argues that indifference to historicity by both the purveyor and the recipient, contempt for expert opinion that contradicts it, and ideological motivation are its key characteristics. Taking a multidisciplinary approach, this work explores some of the following questions: What exactly is post-truth history? Does it represent a new phenomenon? Does the historian have a special role to play in preserving public memory from 'alternative facts'? Do academics more generally have an obligation to combat fake news and fake history both in universities and on social media? How has a 'post-truth culture' impacted professional and popular historical discourse? Looking at theoretical dimensions and case studies from around the world, this book explores the violent potential of post-truth history and calls on readers to resist."

        "summary": "The Marvel Cinematic \u200bUniverse (MCU) is the most expansive and widely viewed fictional narrative in the history of cinema. In 2009, Disney purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion, including its subsidiary film production company, Marvel Studios. Since then, the MCU\u2014the collection of multimedia Marvel Studios products that share a single fictional storyline\u2014has grown from two feature films to thirty interconnected movies, nine streaming Disney+ series, a half dozen short films, and more than thirty print titles. By 2022, eight of the twenty-five highest grossing films of all time are MCU movies. The MCU is a deeply political universe. Intentionally or not, the MCU sends fans scores of messages about a wide range of subjects related to government, public policy, and society. Some are overt, like the contentious debate about government and accountability at the heart of Captain America: Civil War. More often, however, the politics of the MCU are subtle, like the changing role of women from supporting characters (like Black Widow in Iron Man 2) to leading heroes (like Black Widow in Black Widow). The MCU is not only a product of contemporary politics, but many of its stories seem to be direct responses to the problems of the day. Racial injustice, environmental catastrophe, and political misinformation are not just contemporary social ills, they are also key thematic elements of recent MCU blockbusters. In The Politics of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, more than twenty-five leading scholars examine these complex themes. Part one explores how political issues are depicted in the origin stories; part two examines how the MCU depicts classic political themes like government and power; and part three explores questions of diversity and representation in the MCU. The volume\u2019s various chapters examine a wide range of topics: Black Panther and the \u201cracial contract,\u201d Captain America and the political philosophy of James Madison, Dr. Strange and colonial imperialism, S.H.I.E.L.D. and civil-military relations, Spider-Man and environmentalism, and Captain Marvel and second-wave feminism. The Politics of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the first book to look expansively at politics in the MCU and ask the question, \u201cWhat lessons are this entertainment juggernaut teaching audiences about politics, society, power, gender, and inequality?\u201d"

And what kind of transformation of both faith traditions and public policies would be needed in the face of the health justice challenges in our turbulent time? Contributors to the volume come from a wide range of backgrounds, and the result will be of interest to scholars and students in social ethics, development studies, global theology, interreligious studies, and global health as well as experts, practitioners, and policy-makers in health and development work."

Jeremy Tiang's enthralling translation of this important work of fiction was awarded a PEN/Heim Grant."

        "summary": "For nearly twenty years, social scientists and policy makers have been highly interested in the idea of the creative economy. This book contends that mainstream considerations of the economic and social force of culture, including theories of the creative class and of cognitive and immaterial labor, are indebted to historic conceptions of the art of literary authorship. What's more, it shows how contemporary literature has been involved in and has responded to creative-economy phenomena, including the presentation of artists as models of contentedly flexible and self-managed work, the treatment of training in and exposure to art as a pathway to social inclusion, the use of culture and cultural institutions to increase property values, and support for cultural diversity as a means of growing cultural markets. Contemporary writers have not straightforwardly bemoaned these phenomena in a classic rejection of the instrumental application of art. Rather, they have tended to explore how their own critical capacities have become compatible with or even essential to a neoliberal economy that has embraced art's autonomous gestures as proof that authentic self-articulation and social engagement can and should occur within capitalism. Taking a sociological approach to literary criticism, Brouillette interprets major works of contemporary fiction by Monica Ali, Aravind Adiga, Daljit Nagra, and Ian McEwan alongside government policy, social science, and theoretical explorations of creative work and immaterial labor."

This witty primer will help.\u201d \u2014The New York Times Book Review An exploration of how the most ordinary words can be turned into verbal constellations of extraordinary grace through the art of building sentences The sentence is the common ground where every writer walks. A good sentence can be written (and read) by anyone if we simply give it the gift of our time, and it is as close as most of us will get to making something truly beautiful. Using minimal technical terms and sources ranging from the Bible and Shakespeare to George Orwell and Maggie Nelson, as well as scientific studies of what can best fire the reader's mind, author Joe Moran shows how we can all write in a way that is clear, compelling and alive. Whether dealing with finding the ideal word, building a sentence, or constructing a paragraph, First You Write a Sentence informs by light example: much richer than a style guide, it can be read not only for instruction but for pleasure and delight. And along the way, it shows how good writing can help us notice the world, make ourselves known to others, and live more meaningful lives. It's an elegant gem in praise of the English sentence."

Roberta spends her life trying not to take up space. At almost thirty, she is adrift and alienated from life. Stuck in a mindless job and reluctant to pursue her passion for food, she suppresses her appetite and recedes to the corners of rooms. But when she meets Stevie, a spirited and effervescent artist, their intense friendship sparks a change in Roberta, a shift in her desire for more. Together, they invent the Supper Club, a transgressive and joyous collective of women who gather to celebrate, rather than admonish, their hungers. They gather after dark and feast until they are sick; they break into private buildings and leave carnage in their wake; they embrace their changing bodies; they stop apologizing. For these women, each extraordinary yet unfulfilled, the club is a way to explore, discover, and push the boundaries of the space they take up in the world. Yet as the club expands, growing in both size and rebellion, Roberta is forced to reconcile herself to the desire and vulnerabilities of the body--and the past she has worked so hard to repress. Devastatingly perceptive and savagely funny, Supper Club is an essential coming-of-age story for our times."

Under the spell of a mother's madness, the French countryside transforms into a dreamscape of interconnected imagery: animals, desire, the functions of the body. Most troublingly: the comfort of a teenage son. Scorning the bourgeois mores and conventionality of their small town, she withdraws him from school and the two embark on ever more antisocial and dangerous behavior. Harwicz is at her best here, building an interior world so robust, and so grotesque, that it eclipses our shared reality. Savage, and savagely funny, she leaves us singed, if not scorched. -- Publisher's description."

Chapter One reviews the student projects of the 16th annual Break the Cycle of Children's Environmental Health Disparities program, an annual collaborative interdisciplinary research and training program involving university students in academic tracks focusing on the impact of adverse social, economic, and environmental factors on children's health, development, education, and prospects for their future. Chapter Two is a broad overview of the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Texas juvenile justice system. Chapter Three examines the six month outcomes of malnourished children who are enrolled in the Nutritional Therapeutic program in a peri-urban, low-income settlement in the Western Cape, South Africa. Chapter Four asks the question, \"Does early life phthalate exposure mediate racial disparities in children's cognitive abilities?\" Chapter Five assesses the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of families with a low socioeconomic status in regards to phthalate exposure in children. Chapter Six examines a comparison of the Neighborhood Deprivation Index and food desert status as environmental predictors of early childhood obesity. Chapter Seven takes a look at the implications for children's mental health in Durham, North Carolina, on account of equitable access to greenspace during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chapter Eight reviews neighborhood quality and positive health indicators among urban adolescents. Chapter Nine looks to the development of evidence-based intervention for teens that have lost a parent through human-centered design, seeking to create a grief group for today's teens."

        "summary": "\"The emergence and the activities of a second public sphere in the areas of Soviet influence were intricately linked to the performative and intermedial production and usage of alternative spaces. Applying a multitude of perspectives and networked topography, The Hungarian Avant-Garde in Late Socialism investigates artistic strategies of spaces ? namely those of the artist's studio, exhibitions, installations, clubs, apartments, cellars, chapels, and shop windows ? all of which existed parallel to or were interwoven with the regulated public sphere in Hungary from the beginning of the 1960s to the era immediately following the Kd\u0300r\u0300 regime. This book captures and discusses the exclusionary and inclusionary mechanisms inscribed into public spheres behind the Iron Curtain in all their paradoxes through the looking glass of an artist generation that was controversially labeled ?neo-?, and later, ?trans-avant-garde?. Cross-referencing the international tendencies in the art worlds between and beyond the Cold War reality of Blocs, The Hungarian Avant-Garde in Late Socialism demonstrates how mostly non-conformist artists in Hungary, and of course the spaces they created, reacted to the dependency inherent to the conflicting, contradictory nature of public spheres in the post-totalitarian condition.\"--"

        "summary": "American Colonial Spaces in the Philippines tells the story of US colonialists who attempted, in the first decades of the twentieth century, to build an enduring American empire in the Philippines through the production of space. From concrete interventions in infrastructure, urban planning, and built environments to more abstract projects of mapping and territorialization, the book traces the efforts of US Insular Government agents to make space for empire in the Philippines through forms of territory, map, landscape, and road, and how these spaces were understood as solutions to problems of colonial rule. Through the lens of space, the book offers an original history of a highly transformative, but largely misunderstood or forgotten, imperial moment, when the Philippine archipelago, made up of thousands of islands and an ethnically and religiously diverse population of more than seven million, became the unlikely primary setting for US experimentation with formal colonial governance. Telling that story around key figures including Cameron Forbes, Daniel Burnham, Dean Worcester, and William Howard Taft, the book provides distinctive chapters dedicated to spaces of territory (sovereignty), maps (knowledge), landscape (aesthetics), and roads (circulation), suggesting new and integrative historical geographical approaches. This book will be of interest to students of Cultural, Historical, and Political Geography, American History, American Studies, Philippine Studies, Southeast Asia/Philippines; Asian Studies as well as general readers interested in these areas."

While people of African descent have formed part of most borderlands histories, this study recognizes and explains their critical contribution to the formation of frontier spaces. Lack of imperial control coupled with Spain's desperation for settlers and soldiers in frontier areas facilitated the social mobility of Afro-descendants. This need allowed African descendants to become not just members of borderland societies but leaders of it as well. They were essential actors in helping to shape the limits of the Spanish empire. Africans and Afro-descendants built, opposed, and shaped Spanish hegemony in the borderlands, taking on roles that would have been impossible or difficult in colonial centers due to the socio-racial hierarchy of imperial policies and practices."

        "summary": "In Ejaculate Responsibly, Gabrielle Blair expands on her viral Twitter thread and offers a provocative reframing of the abortion issue. In a series of 25 brief arguments, she deftly makes the case for moving the abortion debate away from controlling and legislating women\u2019s bodies and instead directs the focus on men\u2019s lack of accountability in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Highly readable, accessible, funny, and unflinching, Blair builds her argument by walking readers through the basics of fertility (men are 50 times more fertile than woman), the unfair burden placed on women when it comes to preventing pregnancy (90% of the birth control market is for women), the wrongheaded stigmas around birth control for men (condoms make sex less pleasurable, vasectomies are scary and emasculating), and the counterintuitive reality that men, who are fertile 100% of the time, take little to no responsibility for preventing pregnancy."

        "summary": "The arduous, confusing and fraught journey that immigrants take through immigration court Each year, hundreds of thousands of migrants are moved through immigration court. With a national backlog surpassing one million cases, court hearings take years and most migrants will eventually be ordered deported. The Slow Violence of Immigration Court sheds light on the experiences of migrants from the \u201cNorthern Triangle\u201d (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) as they navigate legal processes, deportation proceedings, immigration court, and the immigration system writ large. Grounded in the illuminating stories of people facing deportation, the family members who support them, and the attorneys who defend them, The Slow Violence of Immigration Court invites readers to question matters of fairness and justice and the fear of living with the threat of deportation. Although the spectacle of violence created by family separation and deportation is perceived as extreme and unprecedented, these long legal proceedings are masked in the mundane and are often overlooked, ignored, and excused. In an urgent call to action, Maya Pagni Barak deftly demonstrates that deportation and family separation are not abhorrent anomalies, but are a routine, slow form of violence at the heart of the U.S. immigration system."

        "summary": "A historian offers a unique look at the pandemic, climate change, and the human versus nonhuman. The experience of the pandemic--not unrelated to climate change--has clearly given rise to some new questions and perspectives on issues to do with the human and the nonhuman. One Planet, Many Worlds opens with a discussion of the pandemic, then moves on to a problem of the separation between \"natural\" and \"human\" histories, and what may be at stake in that separation. Finally, it deals with the question suggested by the title of this book: Does having different worlds make it difficult for humans to deal with a planet that is one? This book is both a prequel and a sequel to Chakrabarty's acclaimed The Climate of History in a Planetary Age and is a window into his current thinking on the subject of climate in the Anthropocene."

While university libraries strive to meet the needs of all students, some groups have traditionally been overlooked. This volume engages with those underserved populations on college campuses, with an emphasis on those facing trauma, abuse, and discrimination. It brings a variety of authorial voices to discuss different aspects of that service and to share current research related to underserved populations in libraries. This combination supports research in LIS and beyond while offering concrete ways for service providers to make a difference in the lives of their patrons. Editors Skinner and Gross have both conducted extensive research in ethically meeting patron needs. They and their contributors are keenly aware of the complex and interwoven considerations that inform such service, such as patron desire for confidentiality accompanied by an urgent need for assistance. This volume is committed to sharing diverse voices in the field and to exploring the interrelationship between theoretical findings and practical applications\u2014all in the service of underserved patrons."

        "summary": "This book investigates the science behind \"big liars\"--those rare people who use lies as their principal way of navigating life. Most people are mostly honest, most of the time. And there aren't that many big, pants-on-fire liars in the population overall. But just a few big liars can have an outsized impact on the people around them--ruining personal relationships, bankrupting businesses, and even, when they attain political power, undermining the fabric of society. Big Liars explores this small but dangerous group through the lens of psychological science. Fascinating new research gives us insight into the nature of dishonesty and dishonest people, explaining who lies, what types of people lie a lot, how often people lie, how big liars are created, how they operate, how we can recognize them, and how we can avoid being victimized by them. This book has crucial implications for mental health treatment, as well as our efforts to grapple with the effects of big liars--and their big lies--on social movements and society as a whole."

        "summary": "On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County, in a 6-to-3 decision with a majority opinion authored by conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. The decision was a surprise to many, if not most, observers, but as Jason Pierceson explores in this work, it was not completely unanticipated. The decision was grounded in a recent but well-developed shift in federal jurisprudence on the question of LGBTQ rights that occurred around 2000, with gender identity claims faring better in federal court after decades of skepticism. The most important precedent for these cases was a 1989 Supreme Court case that did not deal directly with LGBTQ rights: Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins. The court ruled in Price Waterhouse that \u201csex stereotyping\u201d is a form of discrimination under Title VII, a provision that prohibits discrimination in employment based upon sex. Ann Hopkins was a cisgender heterosexual woman who was denied a promotion at her accounting firm for being too \u201cmasculine.\u201d At the time of the decision, and in the wake of the devastating decision for the LGBTQ movement in Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), the case was not viewed as creating a strong precedential foundation for LGBTQ rights claims, especially claims based upon sexual orientation. Even in the context of gender identity, the connection was not made to the emerging movement for transgender rights until a decade later. In the 2000s, however, federal courts were consistently applying the case to protect transgender individuals. While not the result of coordinated litigation, nor initially connected to the LGBTQ rights movement, Price Waterhouse has been one of the most important and powerful precedents in recent years outside of the marriage equality cases. Before Bostock tells the story of how this \u201caccidental\u201d precedent evolved into such a crucial case for contemporary LGBTQ rights. Pierceson examines the groundbreaking Supreme Court decision of Bostock v. Clayton County through the legal path created by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the interpretation of the word \u201csex\u201d over time. Focusing on history, courageous LGBTQ plaintiffs, and the careful work of legal activists, Before Bostock illustrates how the courts can expand LGBTQ rights when legislators are more resistant, and it adds to our understanding about contemporary judicial policymaking in the context of statutory interpretation."
